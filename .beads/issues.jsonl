See rationale below.\n\n## Overview (from PLAN Section 6 and 8)\nReplace O(n) linear scan with O(√n) approximate nearest neighbor search using IVF (Inverted File Index) or HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World).\n\n## Why Deferred\n\n### 1. Precision Concerns\nCASS is a precision-focused code search tool. Users expect exact results. Approximate search could return different results than exact search, which is unacceptable without explicit user opt-in.\n\n### 2. Complexity vs Benefit\n- Current optimizations (Opt 1-3) already achieve 20-30x speedup\n- 56ms → 2-3ms with exact search preserved\n- Additional speedup from ANN has diminishing returns\n\n### 3. Implementation Effort\n- HIGH effort: requires new index structure, rebuild logic, query path\n- Lower confidence than other optimizations\n- More testing burden for approximate equivalence\n\n## Future Implementation Notes\n\nIf implemented later:\n- **Require explicit opt-in**: `--approximate` flag\n- **Show confidence/recall metrics** to user\n- **Index format**: IVF with 100-1000 clusters or HNSW with M=16, efConstruction=200\n- **Libraries**: Consider `hnsw` crate or implement from scratch\n\n## Opportunity Matrix Score\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Impact | O(n) → O(√n) |\n| Confidence | LOW |\n| Effort | HIGH |\n| Score | 2.0 (lowest) |\n\n## Dependencies\n- Should only consider after Opt 1-8 are complete and measured\n- Part of Epic: coding_agent_session_search-rq7z","notes":"Implemented foundation for HNSW-based ANN:\n- Added hnsw_rs dependency\n- Created src/search/ann_index.rs with HnswIndex wrapper\n- Added --approximate flag to Search command (CLI)\n- Added --build-hnsw flag to Index command (CLI)\n- Integrated HNSW building into semantic indexer\n- Updated IndexOptions struct to include build_hnsw field\n- All tests pass\n\nRemaining work:\n- Wire up --approximate flag to use HNSW at search time\n- Implement proper HNSW loading (currently placeholder)\n- Add recall/confidence metrics display\n- Test with real datasets","status":"closed","priority":4,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-10T03:29:48.555464020Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-28T18:17:21.940290730Z","closed_at":"2026-01-28T18:17:21.940219437Z","close_reason":"done","compaction_level":0}

Each tool (xf, cass) bundles its own daemon - they work independently without requiring the other to be installed.\n\n## Critical Architecture: Independent Tools\n\n**Problem**: xf and cass must work independently without requiring each other to be installed.\n\n**Solution**: Each tool bundles its own daemon implementation, but they're wire-compatible and can share if both are installed.\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                    WIRE-COMPATIBLE DAEMONS                      │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                                 │\n│  xf (standalone)           cass (standalone)                   │\n│  ┌──────────────┐          ┌──────────────┐                    │\n│  │ xf binary    │          │ cass binary  │                    │\n│  │  └─ daemon   │          │  └─ daemon   │                    │\n│  │     module   │          │     module   │                    │\n│  └──────────────┘          └──────────────┘                    │\n│         │                         │                            │\n│         │ Same socket path: /tmp/semantic-daemon-$USER.sock    │\n│         │                         │                            │\n│         ▼                         ▼                            │\n│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐                    │\n│  │  Shared UDS Socket (first-come wins)   │                    │\n│  │  - First tool to need it spawns daemon │                    │\n│  │  - Second tool connects to existing    │                    │\n│  │  - Either daemon can serve both tools  │                    │\n│  └────────────────────────────────────────┘                    │\n│                                                                 │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n### 1. Each Tool Has Full Daemon Code\n```rust\n// In cass/src/daemon/mod.rs (INDEPENDENT copy, not imported from xf)\npub mod client;\npub mod core;\npub mod models;\npub mod protocol;\npub mod resource;\n\n// Protocol is wire-compatible with xf's daemon\npub use protocol::{Request, Response, PROTOCOL_VERSION};\n```\n\n### 2. Shared Socket Path\n```rust\nfn default_socket_path() -> PathBuf {\n    // Same path for both tools - enables sharing\n    let user = std::env::var(\"USER\").unwrap_or_else(|_| \"unknown\".into());\n    PathBuf::from(format!(\"/tmp/semantic-daemon-{}.sock\", user))\n}\n```\n\n### 3. First-Come Spawns, Others Connect\n```rust\nimpl DaemonClient {\n    pub async fn connect_or_spawn() -> Result<Self> {\n        let socket = default_socket_path();\n        \n        // Try to connect to existing daemon\n        if let Ok(client) = Self::connect(&socket).await {\n            tracing::info!(\"Connected to existing daemon\");\n            return Ok(client);\n        }\n        \n        // No daemon running - spawn our own\n        tracing::info!(\"Spawning daemon\");\n        spawn_daemon(&socket).await?;\n        \n        // Connect to newly spawned daemon\n        Self::connect(&socket).await\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Wire-Compatible Protocol\nBoth tools use identical MessagePack protocol:\n```rust\npub enum Request {\n    Health,\n    Embed { texts: Vec<String>, model: String, dims: Option<usize> },\n    Rerank { query: String, documents: Vec<String>, model: String },\n    Status,\n    Shutdown,\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation for cass\n\n### File Structure\n```\ncass/src/\n├── daemon/\n│   ├── mod.rs          # Re-exports\n│   ├── client.rs       # DaemonClient (connect, embed, rerank)\n│   ├── core.rs         # ModelDaemon server\n│   ├── models.rs       # ModelManager, lazy loading\n│   ├── protocol.rs     # Request/Response types (wire-compatible)\n│   └── resource.rs     # Memory monitoring, nice/ionice\n├── search/\n│   └── semantic.rs     # Uses DaemonClient\n└── main.rs\n```\n\n### Key Differences from xf\n\nThe daemon code is a **copy**, not a dependency:\n- Same protocol version (wire-compatible)\n- Same socket path (can share daemon)\n- Same model loading logic\n- Independent compilation (no xf dependency)\n\n### When Tools Share a Daemon\n\nIf user has both xf and cass installed:\n1. User runs `xf search \"query\"` → xf spawns daemon\n2. User runs `cass search \"query\"` → cass connects to existing daemon\n3. Both tools share warm models\n4. Either tool stopping doesn't affect the other (daemon keeps running)\n\n### When Tools Run Alone\n\nIf user only has cass:\n1. User runs `cass search \"query\"` → cass spawns its own daemon\n2. Works exactly the same, no xf dependency\n\n## Unit Tests\n```rust\n#[tokio::test]\nasync fn test_daemon_spawns_independently() {\n    // cass should be able to spawn daemon without xf\n    let client = DaemonClient::connect_or_spawn().await.unwrap();\n    let health = client.health().await.unwrap();\n    assert!(health.uptime_secs >= 0);\n}\n\n#[tokio::test]\nasync fn test_connect_to_existing_daemon() {\n    // Spawn daemon\n    let _first = DaemonClient::connect_or_spawn().await.unwrap();\n    \n    // Second connection should reuse\n    let second = DaemonClient::connect_or_spawn().await.unwrap();\n    let health = second.health().await.unwrap();\n    assert!(health.uptime_secs > 0); // Already running\n}\n\n#[test]\nfn test_protocol_wire_compatibility() {\n    // Ensure our protocol matches xf's\n    let req = Request::Embed {\n        texts: vec![\"test\".into()],\n        model: \"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\".into(),\n        dims: None,\n    };\n    let bytes = rmp_serde::to_vec(&req).unwrap();\n    \n    // This should deserialize with xf's protocol types too\n    let decoded: Request = rmp_serde::from_slice(&bytes).unwrap();\n    assert!(matches!(decoded, Request::Embed { .. }));\n}\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] cass works without xf installed\n- [ ] cass daemon is wire-compatible with xf daemon\n- [ ] Tools share daemon when both installed (same socket)\n- [ ] First-to-need spawns, others connect\n- [ ] Fallback to direct inference if daemon unavailable\n- [ ] Unit tests verify independence","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-28T05:03:46.175976789Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-28T17:56:00.001998436Z","closed_at":"2026-01-28T17:56:00.001918007Z","close_reason":"Completed daemon module implementation with: protocol.rs (wire-compatible MessagePack), client.rs (UDS client with auto-spawn), core.rs (ModelDaemon server), models.rs (lazy model loading), resource.rs (memory monitoring, nice/ionice).

Significant architectural change to indexing flow\n2. Need to handle errors in worker thread\n3. Progress reporting becomes async\n4. Cancellation handling\n5. Testing concurrent code\n\n## Verification Plan\n\n1. **Metamorphic test**: Batch vs streaming indexing yield same search results\n2. **Memory test**: Peak RSS stays below threshold during streaming\n3. **Stress test**: Large corpus (100k messages) doesn't OOM\n4. **Cancellation test**: Ctrl-C during indexing doesn't corrupt index\n\n## Rollback Strategy\n\nFeature flag `CASS_STREAMING_INDEX=0` (or `1` to enable) to:\n- Revert to batch collection mode\n- Useful if streaming introduces bugs\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- None technically, but should be implemented after P0/P1 optimizations are stable\n- Lower priority because memory usage is acceptable currently (295 MB)\n- Consider only if targeting memory-constrained environments","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-10T03:03:09.801969864Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-10T03:40:20.975917924Z","closed_at":"2026-01-10T03:40:20.975917924Z","close_reason":"Duplicate of ug6i - consolidated","compaction_level":0}

Download binary (no cargo needed)\n- Shows progress, handles failures gracefully\n\n### Phase 5: Indexing (optional)\n- Triggers `cass index` on remote hosts\n- Runs in background, polls for progress\n- Can skip with --skip-index\n\n### Phase 6: Configuration\n- Generates sources.toml entries\n- Shows preview before saving\n- Allows customization of paths/mappings\n- Creates backup of existing config\n- Validates TOML before writing\n\n### Phase 7: Initial Sync (optional)\n- Runs `cass sources sync --source <name>` for each new source\n- Downloads session data to local machine\n- Can skip with --skip-sync\n\n## Flags Reference\n\n| Flag | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `--hosts <names>` | Only configure these hosts (comma-separated SSH aliases) |\n| `--dry-run` | Preview what would be done, don't make changes |\n| `--resume` | Resume from saved state after interruption |\n| `--non-interactive` | Skip all prompts, use auto-detected defaults |\n| `--skip-install` | Don't install cass on remotes |\n| `--skip-index` | Don't run remote indexing |\n| `--skip-sync` | Don't sync after setup |\n| `--json` | Output progress as JSON for scripting |\n\n## State and Resume\n\nIf setup is interrupted (Ctrl+C, connection lost), state is saved to:\n`~/.config/cass/setup_state.json`\n\nResume with:\n```bash\ncass sources setup --resume\n```\n\nState includes:\n- Hosts probed\n- Hosts selected\n- Installation progress\n- Indexing progress\n\n## Non-Interactive Usage\n\nFor automation/scripting:\n```bash\n# Configure specific hosts with all defaults\ncass sources setup --non-interactive --hosts css,csd\n\n# Skip install and index, just configure\ncass sources setup --non-interactive --hosts css --skip-install --skip-index\n\n# JSON output for parsing\ncass sources setup --non-interactive --hosts css --json\n```\n\n## Generated Configuration\n\nThe wizard generates sources.toml entries like:\n```toml\n[[sources]]\nname = \"css\"\ntype = \"ssh\"\nhost = \"css\"\npaths = [\n    \"~/.claude/projects\",\n    \"~/.codex/sessions\",\n]\nsync_schedule = \"manual\"\n\n[[sources.path_mappings]]\nfrom = \"/data/projects\"\nto = \"/Users/username/projects\"\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"Host unreachable\"\n- Verify SSH config: `ssh <host>` manually\n- Check if host is up: `ping <hostname>`\n- Ensure SSH key is loaded: `ssh-add -l`\n\n### \"Permission denied\"\n- Add SSH key to agent: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`\n- Check authorized_keys on remote\n\n### \"cargo not found\"\n- Install Rust on remote: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`\n- Or use --skip-install and install manually\n\n### \"Compilation failed\"\n- Check disk space on remote\n- Ensure build dependencies: `apt install build-essential` (Debian/Ubuntu)\n- Try downloading binary instead\n\n### \"Index taking too long\"\n- Large session histories can take minutes\n- Check progress: `ssh <host> 'cass index --status'`\n- Index runs in background; setup continues\n\n## See Also\n- `cass sources list` - List configured sources\n- `cass sources sync` - Sync data from sources\n- `cass sources discover` - Just discover hosts (no setup)\n\"#)\n```\n\n### AGENTS.md Update\nAdd detailed section under \"cass — Coding Agent Session Search\":\n```markdown\n### Multi-Machine Search Setup\n\ncass can search across agent sessions from multiple machines. Use the interactive\nsetup wizard for the easiest configuration:\n\n```bash\ncass sources setup\n```\n\n#### What the wizard does:\n1. **Discovers** SSH hosts from your ~/.ssh/config\n2. **Probes** each host to check for:\n   - Existing cass installation\n   - Agent session data (Claude, Codex, Cursor, Gemini)\n   - System resources (disk, memory)\n3. **Lets you select** which hosts to configure\n4. **Installs cass** on remotes if needed\n5. **Indexes** existing sessions on remotes\n6. **Configures** sources.toml with correct paths\n7. **Syncs** data to your local machine\n\n#### For scripting (non-interactive):\n```bash\ncass sources setup --non-interactive --hosts css,csd,yto\n```\n\n#### After setup:\n```bash\n# Search across all sources\ncass search \"database migration\"\n\n# Sync latest data\ncass sources sync --all\n\n# List configured sources\ncass sources list\n```\n\n#### Manual configuration:\nIf you prefer manual setup, edit `~/.config/cass/sources.toml`:\n```toml\n[[sources]]\nname = \"my-server\"\ntype = \"ssh\"\nhost = \"user@server.example.com\"\npaths = [\"~/.claude/projects\"]\n\n[[sources.path_mappings]]\nfrom = \"/home/user/projects\"\nto = \"/Users/me/projects\"\n```\n```\n\n### Architecture Diagram (ASCII for docs)\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                     cass sources setup                          │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                              │\n                              ▼\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  Phase 1: Discovery                                             │\n│  ┌──────────────┐                                               │\n│  │ ~/.ssh/config │ ──parse──▶ [host1, host2, host3, ...]       │\n│  └──────────────┘                                               │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                              │\n                              ▼\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  Phase 2: Parallel Probing                                      │\n│                                                                 │\n│  ┌────────┐  ┌────────┐  ┌────────┐                            │\n│  │ host1  │  │ host2  │  │ host3  │    (concurrent SSH)        │\n│  └────┬───┘  └────┬───┘  └────┬───┘                            │\n│       │           │           │                                 │\n│       ▼           ▼           ▼                                 │\n│  [reachable?] [cass?] [agents?] [resources?]                   │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                              │\n                              ▼\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  Phase 3: Interactive Selection                                 │\n│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │\n│  │  [ ] css    ✓ cass 0.1.50  │ claude, codex, cursor       │   │\n│  │  [x] csd    ✗ not found    │ claude only                 │   │\n│  │  [ ] trj    (unreachable)  │ -

A typical month of sessions is ~50-200MB per machine.\n   Use `du -sh ~/.local/share/cass/sources/` to check.\n\n**Q: Can I sync from machines without SSH config entries?**\nA: Yes. After wizard setup, manually add to sources.toml:\n   ```toml\n   [[sources]]\n   name = \"adhoc-server\"\n   type = \"ssh\"\n   host = \"user@192.168.1.100\"\n   ```\n\n**Q: Do I need cass installed on remote machines?**\nA: For indexing: yes. For sync-only: no, rsync is sufficient.\n   Without remote cass, you sync raw files but can't search remotely.\n\n**Q: Can I exclude certain paths or patterns?**\nA: Not yet. Currently all sessions in configured paths are synced.\n   This is a planned feature.\n\n**Q: How do I remove a source?**\nA: Delete the `[[sources]]` block from sources.toml.\n   Optionally delete synced data: `rm -rf ~/.local/share/cass/sources/<name>`\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] clap doc comments complete with examples\n- [ ] robot-docs section comprehensive\n- [ ] AGENTS.md updated with setup guide\n- [ ] Architecture diagram included (ASCII)\n- [ ] Configuration reference complete\n- [ ] FAQ section addresses common questions\n- [ ] All examples work as documented\n- [ ] Common errors documented with solutions\n- [ ] Searchable keywords for discoverability\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires: Setup command implemented (coding_agent_session_search-dbdl)\n\nLabels: [docs sources]","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-05T13:10:20.793596Z","created_by":"jemanuel","updated_at":"2026-01-05T19:55:31.597995Z","closed_at":"2026-01-05T19:55:31.597995Z","close_reason":"Implemented in commit 60d2f28","compaction_level":0,"labels":["docs","sources"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"coding_agent_session_search-22j1","depends_on_id":"coding_agent_session_search-dbdl","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-05T13:12:17.565620Z","created_by":"jemanuel","metadata":"","thread_id":""}]}

A sharded LRU cache eliminates redundant parsing for repeated accesses,\nwhich is common in browse/expand operations and TUI scrolling.\n\n## Location\n- **File:** src/storage/sqlite.rs\n- **Lines:** After metadata parsing logic\n- **Related:** Search result hydration, TUI viewer, expand command\n\n## Current Implementation\n```rust\nfn get_metadata(row_id: i64) -> Result<ConversationMetadata> {\n    let json_str: String = /* query from SQLite */;\n    serde_json::from_str(&json_str)  // Re-parses every call\n}\n```\n\n## Problem Analysis\n1. **No caching:** Same row parsed multiple times in a session\n2. **TUI hot path:** Scrolling repeatedly accesses same metadata\n3. **Expand operations:** View->Expand->View pattern re-parses same data\n4. **Search refinement:** Narrowing search re-parses overlapping results\n\n## Proposed Solution\n```rust\nuse parking_lot::RwLock;\nuse lru::LruCache;\nuse std::sync::Arc;\nuse std::num::NonZeroUsize;\n\n/// Sharded LRU cache for metadata to reduce lock contention\npub struct MetadataCache {\n    shards: [RwLock<LruCache<i64, Arc<ConversationMetadata>>>; 16],\n    stats: CacheStats,\n}\n\n#[derive(Default)]\npub struct CacheStats {\n    hits: AtomicU64,\n    misses: AtomicU64,\n    evictions: AtomicU64,\n}\n\nimpl MetadataCache {\n    pub fn new(capacity_per_shard: usize) -> Self {\n        Self {\n            shards: std::array::from_fn(|_| {\n                RwLock::new(LruCache::new(\n                    NonZeroUsize::new(capacity_per_shard).unwrap()\n                ))\n            }),\n            stats: CacheStats::default(),\n        }\n    }\n    \n    fn shard_index(&self, row_id: i64) -> usize {\n        // Use good hash distribution\n        let hash = fxhash::hash64(&row_id);\n        (hash as usize) % 16\n    }\n    \n    pub fn get(&self, row_id: i64) -> Option<Arc<ConversationMetadata>> {\n        let shard_idx = self.shard_index(row_id);\n        let mut shard = self.shards[shard_idx].write();\n        \n        if let Some(cached) = shard.get(&row_id) {\n            self.stats.hits.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);\n            Some(Arc::clone(cached))\n        } else {\n            self.stats.misses.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);\n            None\n        }\n    }\n    \n    pub fn insert(&self, row_id: i64, metadata: ConversationMetadata) -> Arc<ConversationMetadata> {\n        let shard_idx = self.shard_index(row_id);\n        let arc = Arc::new(metadata);\n        \n        let mut shard = self.shards[shard_idx].write();\n        if shard.len() == shard.cap().get() {\n            self.stats.evictions.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);\n        }\n        shard.put(row_id, Arc::clone(&arc));\n        \n        arc\n    }\n    \n    pub fn invalidate(&self, row_id: i64) {\n        let shard_idx = self.shard_index(row_id);\n        let mut shard = self.shards[shard_idx].write();\n        shard.pop(&row_id);\n    }\n    \n    pub fn invalidate_all(&self) {\n        for shard in &self.shards {\n            shard.write().clear();\n        }\n    }\n    \n    pub fn stats(&self) -> (u64, u64, u64) {\n        (\n            self.stats.hits.load(Ordering::Relaxed),\n            self.stats.misses.load(Ordering::Relaxed),\n            self.stats.evictions.load(Ordering::Relaxed),\n        )\n    }\n    \n    pub fn hit_rate(&self) -> f64 {\n        let hits = self.stats.hits.load(Ordering::Relaxed);\n        let misses = self.stats.misses.load(Ordering::Relaxed);\n        let total = hits + misses;\n        if total == 0 { 0.0 } else { hits as f64 / total as f64 }\n    }\n}\n\nlazy_static::lazy_static! {\n    pub static ref METADATA_CACHE: MetadataCache = MetadataCache::new(256); // 256 * 16 = 4096 total\n}\n\n/// Get metadata with caching\npub fn get_metadata_cached(conn: &Connection, row_id: i64) -> Result<Arc<ConversationMetadata>> {\n    // Check cache first (fast path)\n    if let Some(cached) = METADATA_CACHE.get(row_id) {\n        return Ok(cached);\n    }\n    \n    // Cache miss - parse from database\n    let json_str: String = conn.query_row(\n        \"SELECT metadata FROM conversations WHERE rowid = ?\",\n        [row_id],\n        |row| row.get(0),\n    )?;\n    \n    let metadata: ConversationMetadata = serde_json::from_str(&json_str)?;\n    Ok(METADATA_CACHE.insert(row_id, metadata))\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. [ ] **Add dependencies:** parking_lot, lru, fxhash to Cargo.toml\n2. [ ] **Implement MetadataCache:** With sharding and stats collection\n3. [ ] **Integrate with get_metadata:** Wrap existing function\n4. [ ] **Add invalidation hooks:** Call invalidate on UPDATE/DELETE\n5. [ ] **Add CLI stats command:** `cass cache-stats` for debugging\n6. [ ] **Benchmark:** Compare TUI scroll with/without cache\n7. [ ] **Tune capacity:** Based on typical working set size\n\n## Cache Configuration\n```rust\n/// Cache configuration (can be made configurable via env)\npub struct CacheConfig {\n    /// Total

capacity\n- [ ] Linear scaling with concurrent readers (RwLock)\n- [ ] Proper invalidation on database updates\n- [ ] All unit and integration tests pass\n\n## Considerations\n- **parking_lot vs std::sync:** parking_lot RwLock has better performance for short critical sections\n- **Shard count:** 16 shards balance distribution vs overhead; power of 2 for fast modulo\n- **Memory bounds:** 4096 entries * ~1KB avg = ~4MB, plus Arc overhead\n- **Invalidation:** Must be called on UPDATE/DELETE; consider database triggers\n\n## Related Files\n- src/storage/sqlite.rs (cache integration)\n-

Add Rayon Import\nRayon is already a dependency. Just add:\n```rust\nuse rayon::prelude::*;\n```\n\n### 2. Add Parallel Threshold Constant\n```rust\n/// Minimum index size to use parallel search.\n/// Below this, Rayon overhead (~1-5µs/task) outweighs benefit.\nconst PARALLEL_THRESHOLD: usize = 10_000;\n\n/// Chunk size for parallel iteration.\n/// 1024 gives ~49 chunks for 50k vectors, good for 4-8 core systems.\nconst PARALLEL_CHUNK_SIZE: usize = 1024;\n```\n\n### 3. Implement search_top_k_parallel\n```rust\npub fn search_top_k_parallel(\n    &self,\n    query_vec: &[f32],\n    k: usize,\n    filter: Option<&SemanticFilter>,\n) -> Result<Vec<VectorSearchResult>> {\n    // Skip parallelism for small indices\n    if self.rows.len() < PARALLEL_THRESHOLD {\n        return self.search_top_k(query_vec, k, filter);\n    }\n\n    // Parallel scan with thread-local heaps\n    let results: Vec<_> = self.rows\n        .par_chunks(PARALLEL_CHUNK_SIZE)\n        .flat_map(|chunk| {\n            let mut local_heap = BinaryHeap::with_capacity(k + 1);\n            for row in chunk {\n                // Filter check (uses let_chains, requires Rust 1.76+)\n                if let Some(f) = filter {\n                    if !f.matches(row) { continue; }\n                }\n                \n                let score = self.dot_product_at(row.vec_offset, query_vec)\n                    .unwrap_or(0.0);\n                    \n                local_heap.push(Reverse(ScoredEntry {\n                    score,\n                    message_id: row.message_id,\n                    chunk_idx: row.chunk_idx,\n                }));\n                \n                if local_heap.len() > k { local_heap.pop(); }\n            }\n            local_heap.into_vec()\n        })\n        .collect();\n\n    // Merge thread-local results\n    let mut final_heap = BinaryHeap::with_capacity(k + 1);\n    for entry in results {\n        final_heap.push(entry);\n        if final_heap.len() > k { final_heap.pop(); }\n    }\n\n    // Convert to results with deterministic ordering\n    let mut results: Vec<VectorSearchResult> = final_heap\n        .into_iter()\n        .map(|e| VectorSearchResult {\n            message_id: e.0.message_id,\n            chunk_idx: e.0.chunk_idx,\n            score: e.0.score,\n        })\n        .collect();\n    \n    // Sort by score desc, then message_id asc for determinism\n    results.sort_by(|a, b| {\n        b.score.total_cmp(&a.score)\n            .then_with(|| a.message_id.cmp(&b.message_id))\n    });\n    \n    Ok(results)\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add Env Var Toggle\n```rust\npub fn search_top_k(\n    &self,\n    query_vec: &[f32],\n    k: usize,\n    filter: Option<&SemanticFilter>,\n) -> Result<Vec<VectorSearchResult>> {\n    if env_disabled(\"CASS_PARALLEL_SEARCH\") {\n        self.search_top_k_sequential(query_vec, k, filter)\n    } else {\n        self.search_top_k_parallel(query_vec, k, filter)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Rename Original to search_top_k_sequential\nKeep the original implementation for fallback/comparison.\n\n## Correctness Notes\n\n### Why This Is Safe\n1. `VectorRow` is Send+Sync (verified in Opt 3.1)\n2. `dot_product_at` only reads immutable data\n3. Each thread has its own heap (no sharing)\n4. Merge is deterministic\n\n### Why Results Are Identical\n- Any entry in global top-k must be in some partition's local top-k\n- Proof: If score S is in global top-k, at least one partition contains S, and S must be in that partition's local top-k\n- Final sort ensures deterministic order for equal scores\n\n## Validation Checklist\n\n- [ ] Code compiles: `cargo check --all-targets`\n- [ ] Lints pass: `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`\n- [ ] Format correct: `cargo fmt --check`\n- [ ] Existing tests pass: `cargo test`\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Requires completion of Opt 3.1 (Send+Sync verified)\n- Best results after Opt 1 (F16 pre-convert) - avoids mmap page fault contention","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-10T03:06:17.560750515Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T17:46:47.146745220Z","closed_at":"2026-01-11T17:46:47.146745220Z","close_reason":"Completed (already implemented in src/search/vector_index.rs)","compaction_level":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"coding_agent_session_search-2fcl","depends_on_id":"coding_agent_session_search-0uje","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T03:30:43.697393046Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"","thread_id":""},{"issue_id":"coding_agent_session_search-2fcl","depends_on_id":"coding_agent_session_search-u07k","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T03:08:33.314235710Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"","thread_id":""}]}

Additionally, the visual styling is plain and doesn't match the premium Terminal Noir design system from the reference webapp.\n\n## User Feedback (Verbatim)\n- \"ALL OF THOSE elements below the top message SHOULD BE SIMPLY ICONS WITHIN THE TOP MESSAGE IN THE UPPER RIGHT\"\n- \"ZEROTH PERCENTILE DESIGN THAT LOOKS LIKE ABSOLUTE DOGSHIT\"\n- \"Look at /dp/agentic_coding_flywheel_setup... for how components are styled in an ultra slick, rich, attractive way\"\n\n## Reference Implementation\nThe Terminal Noir design system in /dp/agentic_coding_flywheel_setup/apps/web/app/globals.css provides:\n- Deep space palette with oklch colors\n- Glassmorphism with backdrop-filter: blur(12px)\n- Colored glow shadows\n- Electric cyan primary (oklch 0.75 0.18 195)\n- Fluid typography scale\n- Responsive breakpoints\n\n## Architecture Problem\nCurrent flow in lib.rs run_export_html():\n1. Each message from JSONL parsed into individual Message struct\n2. No grouping - tool calls become separate messages\n3. Renderer iterates individually, creating separate article elements\n\nRequired flow:\n1. Parse JSONL messages\n2. GROUP messages: assistant msg + following tool calls/results = single group\n3. Render groups: tool calls become badges in parent message header\n\n## Files to Modify\n- src/lib.rs - Add message grouping logic before export\n- src/html_export/renderer.rs - Update to handle grouped messages\n- src/html_export/styles.rs - Premium glassmorphism styling\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Tool calls render as small icons in parent message header (upper-right)\n- Hovering on tool badge shows details in popover\n- Rich glassmorphism visual design matching reference\n- Strong mobile/desktop differentiation\n- Polished light AND dark themes\n- All tests pass\n- User signs off on visual appearance","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-28T21:55:26.170294412Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-28T21:55:26.170294412Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}

This is the foundation that all other remote features depend on.\n\n## Why This Must Come First\n- All other features (sync, filtering, UI) depend on these structures\n- Schema changes are disruptive; better to get them right early\n- Identity collision fix is a correctness prerequisite for remote ingestion\n\n## Key Deliverables\n\n### 1. Source/Origin Type Definitions\nNew Rust types in a new module (suggest: src/sources.rs or src/model/source.rs):\n- Source struct: source_id, kind, host_label, machine_id, config\n- SourceKind enum: Local, Ssh (future: S3, Git)\n- Origin struct: source_id, kind, host (for per-conversation provenance)\n\n### 2. SQLite Schema Changes\n- New sources table\n- New columns on conversations: source_id, origin_host\n- Updated uniqueness: UNIQUE(source_id, agent_id, external_id)\n- Migration handling (backup + rebuild strategy for incompatible changes)\n\n### 3. Tantivy Schema Changes\n- New fields: source_id (STRING|STORED), origin_kind (STRING|STORED), origin_host (STRING|STORED)\n- Schema hash bump to trigger rebuild\n- Backward compatibility handling\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n### Migration Strategy\nTreat the search DB + Tantivy index as rebuildable caches:\n- On schema incompatibility: backup old DB, create fresh, trigger full reindex\n- User-authored state (bookmarks, UI prefs) already separate\n- This avoids brittle table-rewrite migrations\n\n### Uniqueness Fix\nCurrent: UNIQUE(agent_id, external_id)\nProblem: Aider uses filename as external_id → guaranteed collision across machines\nFix: UNIQUE(source_id, agent_id, external_id)\n\n## Dependencies\nNone - this is the foundation\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Source/Origin types compile and are well-documented\n- [ ] sources table created with migration\n- [ ] conversations has source_id column (defaults to \"local\")\n- [ ] Tantivy fields added and schema hash bumped\n- [ ] Existing users can upgrade (DB backup + rebuild path works)\n- [ ] Unit tests for new types","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"","created_at":"2025-12-16T05:53:45.135519Z","updated_at":"2025-12-16T06:45:08.476613Z","closed_at":"2025-12-16T06:45:08.476613Z","close_reason":"Phase 1 epic - organizational container, tasks can proceed independently","compaction_level":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"coding_agent_session_search-495","depends_on_id":"coding_agent_session_search-4f6","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-16T05:55:58.120799Z","created_by":"jemanuel","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}]}

Rationale:\n- cass view needs local file access for source context\n- Offline access is valuable\n- Search performance depends on local index\n- Incremental sync more efficient than per-query fetches\n\n### Provenance as First-Class Fields\nNot just metadata_json - enables:\n- Efficient Tantivy filtering\n- Clean CLI/robot output\n- Type-safe code handling\n\n### Workspace Path Rewriting\nEnables cross-machine workspace filtering:\n- /home/user/projects → /Users/user/projects mapping\n- Makes workspace filters meaningful across machines\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Can add SSH source and sync logs from remote machine\n- [ ] Search results show provenance (source_id, host)\n- [ ] CLI --source filter works correctly\n- [ ] TUI shows visual distinction for remote results\n- [ ] Robot output includes provenance fields\n- [ ] No identity collisions across sources\n- [ ] Existing users can upgrade without data loss\n\n## References\n- SUGGESTED_IMPROVEMENTS_TO_CASS_BASED_ON_CMS.md\n- README.md \"Roadmap & Future Directions\" → \"Collaborative Features\"","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"","created_at":"2025-12-16T05:53:16.799Z","updated_at":"2025-12-17T03:35:42.559826Z","closed_at":"2025-12-17T03:35:42.559826Z","close_reason":"All core Remote Sources functionality complete: Phase 1 (data model), Phase 2 (SSH sync), Phase 3 (CLI provenance), Phase 4 (TUI visual distinction), Phase 5 (sources CLI), Phase 7 (tests).

[ ] **Implement PathTrie:** With corrected longest-prefix matching\n2. [ ] **Add platform handling:** Normalize path separators\n3. [ ] **Build from config:** Convert path_mappings to trie at startup\n4. [ ] **Integrate:** Replace linear scan in resolve_workspace\n5. [ ] **Add fallback:** Graceful degradation if trie build fails\n6. [ ] **Benchmark:** Compare 10, 100, 1000 mappings performance\n\n## Platform Considerations\n```rust\n/// Normalize path for trie lookup\nfn normalize_path(path: &str) -> String {\n

improvement with > 10 workspace mappings\n- [ ] No regression for small mapping counts (< 5)\n- [ ] Correct longest-prefix matching behavior\n- [ ] Platform-agnostic path handling\n- [ ] Property tests verify equivalence with linear scan\n\n## Considerations\n- **Memory overhead:** Trie nodes vs flat list - acceptable for typical configs\n- **Build time:** One-time cost when loading config\n- **Longest prefix match:** Critical for nested project structures\n- **Case sensitivity:** macOS is case-insensitive, Linux is case-sensitive\n- **Path normalization:** Handle trailing slashes, Windows backslashes\n\n## Related Files\n- src/connectors/mod.rs (main implementation)\n- src/sources/config.rs (path_mappings config loading)\n- tests/path_trie.rs (new test file)\n-

Screen Reader Support\n\n#### ARIA Labels\n\n```html\n<!-- Regions -->\n<main role=\"main\" aria-label=\"Search and browse conversations\">\n<nav role=\"navigation\" aria-label=\"Result navigation\">\n<aside role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Conversation details\">\n\n<!-- Dynamic content -->\n<div aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\" id=\"status\">\n  <span class=\"sr-only\">Search results updated</span>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Password field -->\n<label for=\"password-input\" id=\"password-label\">\n  Enter your password to unlock the archive\n</label>\n<input \n  id=\"password-input\" \n  type=\"password\"\n  aria-labelledby=\"password-label\"\n  aria-describedby=\"password-hint\"\n>\n<span id=\"password-hint\" class=\"sr-only\">\n  The password was set when this archive was created\n</span>\n\n<!-- Search results -->\n<ul role=\"listbox\" aria-label=\"Search results\">\n  <li role=\"option\" aria-selected=\"false\" tabindex=\"0\">\n    <span class=\"result-title\">Conversation Title</span>\n    <span class=\"result-meta\" aria-label=\"From Claude Code, January 5 2025\">\n      Claude Code • Jan 5\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n#### Live Regions\n\n```javascript\n// Announce search results\nfunction announceResults(count) {\n    const status = document.getElementById(\"status\");\n    status.textContent = `Found ${count} ${count === 1 ? \"result\" : \"results\"}`;\n}\n\n// Announce errors\nfunction announceError(message) {\n    const error = document.getElementById(\"error-announcer\");\n    error.setAttribute(\"role\", \"alert\");\n    error.textContent = message;\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Visual Design\n\n#### Color Contrast\n\n```css\n/* WCAG AA requires 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text */\n:root {\n    --text-primary: #1a1a1a;      /* On white: 16.1:1 ✓ */\n    --text-secondary: #555555;     /* On white: 7.4:1 ✓ */\n    --text-on-primary: #ffffff;    /* On blue: 8.6:1 ✓ */\n    --primary-color: #0055cc;      /* On white: 7.1:1 ✓ */\n    --error-color: #cc0000;        /* On white: 5.9:1 ✓ */\n    --success-color: #006600;      /* On white: 5.9:1 ✓ */\n}\n\n/* Dont rely on color alone */\n.error-message {\n    color: var(--error-color);\n    border-left: 4px solid var(--error-color);\n}\n.error-message::before {\n    content: \"⚠ \";\n}\n```\n\n#### Focus Indicators\n\n```css\n/* Visible focus for keyboard users */\n:focus {\n    outline: 2px solid var(--primary-color);\n    outline-offset: 2px;\n}\n\n/* Enhanced focus for key elements */\n.search-result:focus,\nbutton:focus,\ninput:focus {\n    outline: 3px solid var(--primary-color);\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 6px rgba(0, 85, 204, 0.2);\n}\n\n/* Remove default outline only when theres a custom one */\n:focus:not(:focus-visible) {\n    outline: none;\n}\n:focus-visible {\n    outline: 3px solid var(--primary-color);\n}\n```\n\n#### Text Sizing\n\n```css\n/* Use relative units */\nhtml {\n    font-size: 100%; /* Respect user preference */\n}\n\nbody {\n    font-size: 1rem;\n    line-height: 1.5;\n}\n\n/* Allow 200% zoom without horizontal scroll */\n@media (max-width: 320px) {\n    .container {\n        padding: 1rem;\n    }\n    .search-result {\n        padding: 0.5rem;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Form Accessibility\n\n```html\n<!-- Proper labels -->\n<div class=\"form-group\">\n    <label for=\"search-input\">Search conversations</label>\n    <input \n        id=\"search-input\" \n        type=\"search\"\n        aria-describedby=\"search-help\"\n        placeholder=\"Type to search...\"\n    >\n    <span id=\"search-help\" class=\"help-text\">\n        Search by keywords, use quotes for exact phrases\n    </span>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Error messages -->\n<div class=\"form-group\" aria-invalid=\"true\">\n    <label for=\"password-input\">Password</label>\n    <input \n        id=\"password-input\" \n        type=\"password\"\n        aria-describedby=\"password-error\"\n        aria-invalid=\"true\"\n    >\n    <span id=\"password-error\" class=\"error\" role=\"alert\">\n        Incorrect password. Please try again.\n    </span>\n</div>\n```\n\n### 5. Motion and Animation\n\n```css\n/* Respect reduced motion preference */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n    *, *::before, *::after {\n        animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n        transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n    }\n}\n\n/* Provide pause controls for any animation */\n.loading-spinner {\n    animation: spin 1s linear infinite;\n}\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n    .loading-spinner {\n        animation: none;\n    }\n    .loading-spinner::after {\n        content: \"Loading...\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Procedures\n\n### Automated Testing\n\n```javascript\n// Using axe-core\nconst { AxeBuilder } = require(\"@axe-core/playwright\");\n\ntest(\"accessibility\", async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto(TEST_URL);\n    \n    const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page })\n        .withTags([\"wcag2a\", \"wcag2aa\", \"wcag21aa\"])\n        .analyze();\n    \n    expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);\n});\n\n// Run on multiple pages\nconst pages = [\"/\", \"/unlock\", \"/search\", \"/conversation\"];\nfor (const path of pages) {\n    test(`accessibility: ${path}`, async ({ page }) => {\n        await page.goto(TEST_URL + path);\n        const results = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze();\n        expect(results.violations).toEqual([]);\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### Manual Testing Checklist\n\n```markdown\n## Keyboard Testing\n- [ ] Can navigate to all interactive elements with Tab\n- [ ] Tab order follows visual layout\n- [ ] Can activate buttons/links with Enter/Space\n- [ ] Can escape from modals with Escape\n- [ ] Focus is visible on all elements\n- [ ] Focus is not trapped unexpectedly\n\n## Screen Reader Testing (VoiceOver/NVDA)\n- [ ] Page title is announced\n- [ ] Headings are properly structured (h1, h2, h3)\n- [ ] All images have alt text\n- [ ] Form fields are properly labeled\n- [ ] Buttons have descriptive names\n- [ ] Dynamic updates are announced\n- [ ] Error messages are announced\n\n## Visual Testing\n- [ ] Text is readable at 200% zoom\n- [ ] No horizontal scroll at 200% zoom\n- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA\n- [ ] Information not conveyed by color alone\n- [ ] Focus indicators are visible\n- [ ] Works with Windows High Contrast mode\n\n## Motion Testing\n- [ ] Respects prefers-reduced-motion\n- [ ] No flashing content (>3 flashes/second)\n- [ ] Animations can be paused\n```\n\n### Screen Reader Testing Script\n\n```markdown\n# VoiceOver Testing (macOS)\n\n1.

However, the SW must be installed first, which means:\n\n1. **First visit**: No SW → No headers → No SharedArrayBuffer\n2. **After reload**: SW active → Headers injected → SharedArrayBuffer works\n\n## UX Flow\n\n### First Visit Detection\n\n```javascript\n// On page load, check if this is first visit\nasync function checkFirstVisit() {\n    // Check if SW is controlling the page\n    const swController = navigator.serviceWorker?.controller;\n    \n    // Check if SharedArrayBuffer is available\n    let hasSAB = false;\n    try {\n        new SharedArrayBuffer(1);\n        hasSAB = true;\n    } catch {\n        hasSAB = false;\n    }\n    \n    return {\n        hasServiceWorker: !!swController,\n        hasSharedArrayBuffer: hasSAB,\n        needsReload: !swController || !hasSAB\n    };\n}\n```\n\n### First-Visit Welcome Screen\n\n```html\n<div id=\"first-visit-screen\" class=\"first-visit\">\n    <h1>🔐 Welcome to cass Archive</h1>\n    <p>Setting up secure environment...</p>\n    \n    <div class=\"setup-progress\">\n        <div class=\"step\" id=\"step-sw\">\n            <span class=\"icon\">⏳</span>\n            Installing security worker...\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"step\" id=\"step-reload\">\n            <span class=\"icon\">○</span>\n            Activating isolation headers...\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    \n    <div id=\"reload-prompt\" class=\"hidden\">\n        <p>Almost there!

First visit → shows setup screen\n2. SW installs → step updates\n3. Countdown → auto-reload after 2s\n4. Cancel → manual reload option\n5. After reload → direct to auth\n6.

The core technical work (export, encryption, web viewer, deployment) is complete by Phase 4; Phase 5 ensures users dont accidentally publish secrets, understand exactly what theyre sharing, and have comprehensive documentation.\n\n## Strategic Importance\n**Why This Phase Exists:**\n1. **Secret Protection**: Coding sessions often contain API keys, tokens, passwords, and other secrets. Even with encryption, secrets in the exported data represent risk if the encryption is ever compromised or if users share passwords carelessly.\n2. **Informed Consent**: Users must understand exactly what data is being published. A pre-publish summary prevents \"I didnt realize that was in there\" regrets.\n3. **Confirmation Gates**: Irreversible actions (publishing to GitHub Pages) require explicit confirmation with clear warnings.\n4. **Documentation**: Users need to understand the security model, trust assumptions, and operational procedures.\n\n## Components\n\n### 5.1 Secret Detection Engine\nScan all exported content for potential secrets before encryption:\n- API keys (AWS, OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub, etc.)\n- Passwords and tokens in various formats\n- Private keys (SSH, PGP, certificates)\n- Connection strings with embedded credentials\n- Environment variable patterns\n\n### 5.2 Pre-Publish Summary\nGenerate comprehensive summary showing:\n- Total conversations and messages being exported\n- Date range of content\n- Workspaces/projects included\n- Detected secrets (with redacted previews)\n- Estimated archive size\n- Key slot configuration\n\n### 5.3 Safety Confirmations\nMulti-step confirmation for irreversible actions:\n- Display warnings about public publishing\n- Require explicit \"I understand\" acknowledgments\n- Option to abort at any stage\n- Clear indication of what will be published where\n\n### 5.4 Documentation Generation\nAuto-generate deployment-specific docs:\n- README for the generated site\n- Security model explanation\n- Recovery procedures\n- Troubleshooting guide\n\n## Dependencies\n- Depends on: Phase 4 (need complete wizard to integrate safety checks)\n- Blocks: Phase 6 (testing validates safety features)\n\n## Exit Criteria\n- [ ] Secret detection catches 95%+ of common secret patterns\n- [ ] Pre-publish summary accurately reflects export contents\n- [ ] Confirmation flow prevents accidental publishing\n- [ ] Generated documentation is complete and accurate\n- [ ] All safety features tested with synthetic secrets","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-07T01:39:46.253684107Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-07T06:03:25.260245274Z","closed_at":"2026-01-07T06:03:25.260245274Z","close_reason":"Duplicate of coding_agent_session_search-2bwi","compaction_level":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"coding_agent_session_search-7s76","depends_on_id":"coding_agent_session_search-w3o7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-07T01:39:52.150107719Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"","thread_id":""}]}

The confirmation flow should:\n1. Require deliberate action (not just pressing Enter)\n2. Display specific warnings tailored to the users configuration\n3.

This ensures we can accurately measure improvement and detect regressions.\n\n## Required Baseline Measurements\n\n### 1. Benchmark Suite (Section 2.1)\nRun and record these benchmarks:\n```bash\ncargo bench --bench search_perf -- --save-baseline main\ncargo bench --bench index_perf -- --save-baseline main\ncargo bench --bench runtime_perf -- --save-baseline main\n```\n\n**Key Metrics to Record:**\n| Benchmark | Current p50 | Target |\n|-----------|-------------|--------|\n| `vector_index_search_50k` | 56.1 ms | 2-3 ms |\n| `vector_index_search_10k` | 11.2 ms | <1 ms |\n| `search_latency` (40 convs) | 10.5 µs | <5 µs |\n| `wildcard_large_dataset/substring` | 7.5 ms | <2 ms |\n| `canonicalize_long_message` | 951 µs | ~300 µs |\n| `index_small_batch` | 13.3 ms | maintain |\n\n### 2. Indexing Metrics (Section 2.2)\nFor a corpus of 3000 conversations × 12 messages = 36,000 messages:\n- `elapsed_ms`: p50/p95/p99\n- wall clock time\n- throughput (messages/s)\n- peak RSS (MB)\n\n```bash\n# Generate profiling corpus\ncargo run --release -- index --full 2>&1 | tee /tmp/index_baseline.log\n```\n\n### 3. Search Latency by Query Type (Section 2.3)\nRun N=200 iterations for each query type:\n| Query Type | p50 | p95 | p99 |\n|-----------|-----|-----|-----|\n| exact (`serialize`) | 3ms | 4ms | 4ms |\n| prefix (`ser*`) | 3ms | 3ms | 4ms |\n| suffix (`*ialize`) | 6ms | 7ms | 7ms |\n| substring (`*erial*`) | 9ms | 10ms | 10ms |\n| phrase (`\"serialize benchmark\"`) | 3ms | 4ms | 4ms |\n\n**IMPORTANT**: CLI-per-search includes cold-open costs.

Update models.manifest.toml in new cass release\n2. On startup, compare installed model revision vs manifest\n3. If mismatch: set state to UpdateAvailable (notify only, don't auto-upgrade)\n4. User runs `cass models install --upgrade` to update\n5. After model update, vector index is automatically rebuilt\n\nWhy notify-only? Auto-upgrading could:\n- Use bandwidth unexpectedly\n- Break workflows if new model has different behavior\n- Cause confusion if results change\n\n## Download System\n- Resumable (HTTP Range header)\n- Progress reporting via channel\n- Exponential backoff (3 retries, 5s → 15s → 45s)\n- Timeout: 5 minutes per file\n- Clean up partial files on cancel/failure\n\n## Verification + Atomic Install\n- Download to models/<name>.downloading/\n- Verify SHA256 for each file\n- Atomic rename to models/<name>/\n- Write .verified marker with timestamp + revision\n\n## Index Migration on Model Change\nWhen model revision changes:\n1. Detect: installed model revision != index metadata embedder_revision\n2. Mark semantic as unavailable temporarily\n3. Rebuild vector index in background\n4.

By batching f16→f32\nconversions and using 8-wide SIMD operations, we can achieve 40-60% speedup.\n\n## Location\n- **File:** src/search/vector_index.rs\n- **Lines:** ~850-890 (dot_product_f16 function)\n- **Related:** CVVI header parsing, vector search hot path\n\n## Current Implementation\n```rust\nfn dot_product_f16(a: &[f16], b: &[f16]) -> f32 {\n    a.iter()\n        .zip(b.iter())\n        .map(|(x, y)| f32::from(*x) * f32::from(*y))\n        .sum()\n}\n```\n\n## Problem Analysis\n1. **Scalar operations:** Each f16→f32 conversion is individual\n2. **No SIMD:** Doesn't leverage f32x8 instructions available in `wide` crate\n3. **Cache unfriendly:** Alternating reads from two arrays\n4. **Hot path:** Called for every vector similarity comparison\n\n## Proposed Solution\n```rust\nuse wide::f32x8;\n\n/// SIMD-accelerated f16 dot product with detailed logging\npub fn dot_product_f16_simd(a: &[f16], b: &[f16]) -> f32 {\n    debug_assert_eq!(a.len(), b.len(), \"Vector dimensions must match\");\n    \n    if a.is_empty() {\n        return 0.0;\n    }\n    \n    let chunks = a.len() / 8;\n    let mut acc = f32x8::ZERO;\n    \n    // Main SIMD loop - process 8 elements at a time\n    for i in 0..chunks {\n        let base = i * 8;\n        \n        // Convert 8 f16 values to f32 array\n        // Note: Using explicit indexing for clarity and bounds check elision\n        let a_f32 = [\n            f32::from(a[base]), f32::from(a[base + 1]),\n            f32::from(a[base + 2]), f32::from(a[base + 3]),\n            f32::from(a[base + 4]), f32::from(a[base + 5]),\n            f32::from(a[base + 6]), f32::from(a[base + 7]),\n        ];\n        let b_f32 = [\n            f32::from(b[base]), f32::from(b[base + 1]),\n            f32::from(b[base + 2]), f32::from(b[base + 3]),\n            f32::from(b[base + 4]), f32::from(b[base + 5]),\n            f32::from(b[base + 6]), f32::from(b[base + 7]),\n        ];\n        \n        let a_vec = f32x8::from(a_f32);\n        let b_vec = f32x8::from(b_f32);\n        acc = a_vec.mul_add(b_vec, acc); // FMA instruction\n    }\n    \n    // Reduce SIMD accumulator to scalar\n    let mut sum = acc.reduce_add();\n    \n    // Handle remainder (0-7 elements)\n    let remainder_start = chunks * 8;\n    for i in remainder_start..a.len() {\n        sum += f32::from(a[i]) * f32::from(b[i]);\n    }\n    \n    sum\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. [ ] **Baseline benchmark:** Add criterion benchmark for current scalar implementation\n   - Test dimensions: 128, 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024, 1536\n   - Measure: throughput (ops/sec), latency (ns/op)\n2.

Considerations\n- **False positives OK:** Just check exact set (tiny overhead)\n- **False negatives BAD:** Never acceptable - bloom filter guarantees none\n- **Update cost:** Rebuild bloom on config

Approximately **50% of the 56ms** is F16→F32 conversion overhead.\n\n### Analysis Details\n- 19.2 million F16→F32 conversions per query (50k vectors × 384 dimensions)\n- Each conversion: ~1-2 CPU cycles for the conversion + memory access\n- Conversions happen per-query, wasting cycles on identical work\n\n### Current Implementation (vector_index.rs:1221-1228)\n```rust\nfn dot_product_f16(a: &[f16], b: &[f32]) -> f32 {\n    a.iter().zip(b.iter()).map(|(x, y)| f32::from(*x) * y).sum()\n}\n```\n\nThe `f32::from(*x)` call happens 384 times per vector, 50k times per query.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nConvert the entire F16 slab to F32 at `VectorIndex::load()` time, paying the conversion cost once instead of per-query.\n\n### Implementation Location\n- File: `src/search/vector_index.rs`\n- Function: `VectorIndex::load()` (around line 100-150)\n- Modify `VectorStorage` enum handling\n\n### Code Sketch\n```rust\n// In VectorIndex::load()\nlet vectors = match header.quantization {\n    Quantization::F16 => {\n        let f16_slice = bytes_as_f16(&mmap[slab_start..slab_end])?;\n        let f32_slab: Vec<f32> = f16_slice.iter().map(|v| f32::from(*v)).collect();\n        VectorStorage::F32(f32_slab)  // Store as F32 in memory\n    }\n    Quantization::F32 => { /* unchanged */ }\n};\n```\n\n## Isomorphism Proof\n\nThis optimization preserves search correctness because:\n1. `f32::from(f16)` is **injective and deterministic** - same input always produces same output\n2. The same conversion happens once at load vs once per-query - mathematically identical\n3. Dot product inputs are identical → outputs are identical\n4. No ranking or result set changes possible\n\n## Trade-offs\n\n### Costs\n- **2x memory usage** for F16 indices: 76.8 MB vs 38.4 MB for 50k × 384 vectors\n- **Loses mmap benefits**: Currently `VectorStorage::Mmap` enables lazy page loading and OS caching. Converting to heap-allocated `Vec<f32>` requires loading entire slab into memory at startup.\n\n### Mitigations\n- Memory increase is acceptable for 20x speedup (76.8 MB is still small)\n- For very large indices, consider keeping mmap with optional \"preload\" flag\n- Most users have plenty of RAM for coding agent conversations\n\n## Expected Impact\n\n| Metric | Before | After |\n|--------|--------|-------|\n| `vector_index_search_50k` | 56ms | ~30ms |\n| Memory (50k F16 vectors) | 38.4 MB | 76.8 MB |\n| Load time | Instant (mmap) | ~10-20ms (conversion) |\n\n## Rollback Strategy\n\nEnvironment variable `CASS_F16_PRECONVERT=0` to:\n- Keep F16 storage and mmap\n- Convert per-query (original behavior)\n- Useful for memory-constrained environments\n\n## Verification Plan\n\n1. Unit tests comparing search results with/without pre-convert\n2. Benchmark comparison showing 40-50% speedup\n3. Property-based test: `search(q).hits.map(|h| h.message_id) ≡ search_preconvert(q).hits.map(|h| h.message_id)`\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- None (first in chain)\n- **Blocks**: Optimization 2 (SIMD) - SIMD works best on uniform F32 data\n- **Blocks**: Optimization 3 (Parallel) - Parallel search benefits from pre-converted data","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-10T02:41:25.188716067Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-10T06:42:31.549131389Z","closed_at":"2026-01-10T06:42:31.549131389Z","close_reason":"Opt 1 F16 Pre-Convert implemented and verified.

Recreate indexes and foreign keys\n\n### Migration SQL\n\\`\\`\\`sql\n-- Create new table\nCREATE TABLE conversations_new (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n    agent_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES agents(id),\n    workspace_id INTEGER REFERENCES workspaces(id),\n    source_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'local' REFERENCES sources(id),\n    external_id TEXT,\n    title TEXT,\n    source_path TEXT NOT NULL,\n    started_at INTEGER,\n    ended_at INTEGER,\n    approx_tokens INTEGER,\n    metadata_json TEXT,\n    origin_host TEXT,\n    UNIQUE(source_id, agent_id, external_id)\n);\n\n-- Copy data\nINSERT INTO conversations_new \nSELECT id, agent_id, workspace_id, 'local', external_id, title, source_path,\n       started_at, ended_at, approx_tokens, metadata_json, NULL\nFROM conversations;\n\n-- Swap tables\nDROP TABLE conversations;\nALTER TABLE conversations_new RENAME TO conversations;\n\n-- Recreate indexes\nCREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_conv_agent_started ON conversations(agent_id, started_at);\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Alternative: Backup & Rebuild Strategy\nGiven that conversations is a rebuildable cache (we can always rescan agent logs), consider:\n1. Detect incompatible schema\n2. Backup old DB to agent_search.db.bak-{timestamp}\n3. Create fresh DB with new schema\n4. Trigger full reindex on next run\n\nThis is simpler and safer for users, though slower (requires full rescan).\n\n## Recommendation\nImplement BOTH:\n- Try table-rewrite migration first\n- If migration fails, fall back to backup+rebuild\n- Log clearly what happened\n\n## API Updates\nUpdate persist_conversation() to accept source_id and origin_host parameters.\n\n## Dependencies\n- P1.2 (sources table must exist for FK)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] source_id column added (defaults to 'local')\n- [ ] origin_host column added\n- [ ] Uniqueness constraint updated\n- [ ] Migration tested with existing data\n- [ ] Backup+rebuild fallback works\n- [ ] persist_conversation updated\n- [ ] Tests verify no collisions across sources","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"","created_at":"2025-12-16T05:54:53.788672Z","updated_at":"2025-12-16T07:07:59.248659Z","closed_at":"2025-12-16T07:07:59.248659Z","close_reason":"Added source_id and origin_host columns to conversations table.

Profile if contention becomes an issue.\n\n## Verification Plan\n\n1. **Fixed-index test**: Repeated wildcard queries produce identical hits\n2. **Cache hit test**: Second query returns cached result (verify via counter)\n3. **Benchmark**: Compare repeated query latency with/without cache\n\n## Rollback Strategy\n\nEnvironment variable `CASS_REGEX_CACHE=0` to:\n- Disable caching\n- Build fresh RegexQuery for every query\n- Useful for debugging cache-related issues\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- May need `lru` crate (or use `std::collections::HashMap` with manual eviction)\n- Independent of vector search optimizations\n\n## Cargo.toml Addition\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nlru = \"*\"  # LRU cache implementation\n```\n\nNote: AGENTS.md specifies wildcard constraints (`*`) for all crates.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-10T03:01:38.591609751Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-10T03:40:04.026008483Z","closed_at":"2026-01-10T03:40:04.026008483Z","close_reason":"Duplicate of 4pdk - consolidated","compaction_level":0}

Add timing points in main search path\n\n```rust\npub fn run_search(args: &SearchArgs) -> Result<SearchResult> {\n    let start_total = Instant::now();\n    \n    // Phase 1: Open index\n    let start_open = Instant::now();\n    let search_client = SearchClient::open(&config)?;\n    let open_ms = start_open.elapsed().as_secs_f64() * 1000.0;\n    \n    // Phase 2: Execute query\n    let start_query = Instant::now();\n    let results = search_client.search(&args.query, args.limit)?;\n    let query_ms = start_query.elapsed().as_secs_f64() * 1000.0;\n    \n    // Phase 3: Format output\n    let start_format = Instant::now();\n    let output = format_results(&results, &args.format)?;\n    let format_ms = start_format.elapsed().as_secs_f64() * 1000.0;\n    \n    let total_ms = start_total.elapsed().as_secs_f64() * 1000.0;\n    \n    Ok(SearchResult {\n        hits: results,\n        meta: SearchMeta {\n            timing: TimingInfo { total_ms, open_ms, query_ms, format_ms },\n            ...\n        }\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Add to robot output schema\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Serialize)]\nstruct TimingInfo {\n    total_ms: f64,\n    open_ms: f64,\n    query_ms: f64,\n    format_ms: f64,\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update robot-docs\n\nDocument the new timing fields in `cass robot-docs timing`.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **Profiling cold-open**: \n   ```bash\n   # Clear filesystem cache, then:\n   cass search \"test\" --robot | jq '.meta.timing.open_ms'\n   ```\n\n2. **Profiling warm queries**:\n   ```bash\n   # Second query (index already cached):\n   cass search \"test\" --robot | jq '.meta.timing.query_ms'\n   ```\n\n3. **Identifying bottlenecks**:\n   - High open_ms, low query_ms → Focus on index loading\n   - Low open_ms, high query_ms → Focus on search algorithm\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Timing breakdown in robot mode output\n- [ ] open_ms, query_ms, format_ms fields added\n- [ ] robot-docs updated\n- [ ] Benchmarks use new timing for analysis\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Independent task, can be done anytime\n- Helpful for measuring other optimizations","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-10T03:22:06.588561060Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-10T03:40:33.609940213Z","closed_at":"2026-01-10T03:40:33.609940213Z","close_reason":"Duplicate of yq6l - consolidated","compaction_level":0}

Implement SIMD Dot Product\nLocation: `src/search/vector_index.rs`\n\n```rust\nuse wide::f32x8;\n\n/// SIMD-accelerated dot product using AVX2 (8-wide) operations.\n/// Falls back to scalar for remainder elements.\nfn dot_product_simd(a: &[f32], b: &[f32]) -> f32 {\n    debug_assert_eq!(a.len(), b.len(), \"Vector length mismatch\");\n    \n    let chunks_a = a.chunks_exact(8);\n    let chunks_b = b.chunks_exact(8);\n    let remainder_a = chunks_a.remainder();\n    let remainder_b = chunks_b.remainder();\n\n    let mut sum = f32x8::ZERO;\n    for (ca, cb) in chunks_a.zip(chunks_b) {\n        // Convert slices to arrays for SIMD\n        let arr_a: [f32; 8] = ca.try_into().unwrap();\n        let arr_b: [f32; 8] = cb.try_into().unwrap();\n        sum += f32x8::from(arr_a) * f32x8::from(arr_b);\n    }\n\n    // Horizontal sum: reduce 8 floats to 1\n    let mut scalar_sum: f32 = sum.reduce_add();\n    \n    // Handle remainder (0-7 elements)\n    for (a, b) in remainder_a.iter().zip(remainder_b) {\n        scalar_sum += a * b;\n    }\n    \n    scalar_sum\n}\n```\n\n### 3.

Rayon reuses threads from its\npool, so thread-locals persist between parallel operations and can cause data leakage.\nThe idiomatic Rayon pattern is fold/reduce:\n\n\\`\\`\\`rust\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\nuse rayon::prelude::*;\n\nfn discover_agents_optimized(paths: &[PathBuf]) -> HashMap<AgentType, Vec<PathBuf>> {\n    paths.par_iter()\n        .fold(\n            // Identity: empty HashMap per worker thread\n            HashMap::new,\n            // Accumulator: add path to local HashMap\n            |mut acc, path| {\n                if let Some(agent_type) = detect_agent(path) {\n                    acc.entry(agent_type)\n                        .or_insert_with(Vec::new)\n                        .push(path.clone());\n                }\n                acc\n            }\n        )\n        .reduce(\n            // Identity for reduction\n            HashMap::new,\n            // Reducer: merge two HashMaps\n            |mut a, b| {\n                for (agent, mut paths) in b {\n                    a.entry(agent)\n                        .or_insert_with(Vec::new)\n                        .append(&mut paths);\n                }\n                a\n            }\n        )\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Why fold/reduce Works\n- **fold:** Each Rayon work-stealing task gets its own HashMap\n- **reduce:** Merges HashMaps in O(log threads) steps\n- **No locks:** All accumulation is local until reduce\n- **Work-stealing friendly:** No shared state during parallel phase\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. [ ] Benchmark current discovery with varying core counts (2, 4, 8, 16)\n2. [ ] Implement fold/reduce pattern in discover_agents\n3. [ ] Verify identical agent discovery results\n4. [ ] Benchmark new implementation with same core counts\n5. [ ] Profile lock contention with perf/dtrace to confirm reduction\n6. [ ] Add logging for discovery phase timing\n\n## Comprehensive Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n\\`\\`\\`rust\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use super::*;\n    \n    /// Test that fold/reduce

{"id":"coding_agent_session_search-hv9t","title":"Epic: Interactive Remote Sources Setup Wizard","description":"# Epic: Interactive Remote Sources Setup Wizard\n\n## Vision\nTransform cass's multi-machine experience from manual configuration to a seamless, \nguided setup process. Users should be able to aggregate their coding agent session \nhistory from multiple machines with minimal friction.\n\n## Current Pain Points\n1. Users must manually edit sources.toml to add remote machines\n2. Users must manually install cass on each remote machine\n3. Users must manually run `cass index` on each remote\n4. Users must manually run `cass sources sync` to pull data\n5. No visibility into what data exists on remotes before configuring\n\n## Target Experience\n```\n$ cass sources setup\n\nDiscovering SSH hosts from ~/.ssh/config...\nFound 5 hosts\n\nProbing hosts (this may take a moment)...\n  css ✓  csd ✓  trj ✓  yto ✓  fmd ✗\n\nSelect hosts to configure as sources:\n  [x] css (209.145.54.164) - cass v0.1.50 ✓ | 1,234 sessions\n  [x] csd (144.126.137.164) - cass v0.1.49 ✓ | 567 sessions\n  [ ] trj (100.91.120.17) - cass not found | Claude, Cursor data detected\n  [x] yto (37.187.75.150) - cass not found | Claude data detected\n  [ ] fmd (51.222.245.56) - unreachable\n\n[space] toggle  [a] all  [n] none  [/] search  [enter] confirm\n\n→ Install cass on 1 selected host without it?

evaluate in subtask)\n- SSH probing via single-command script for efficiency\n- Parallel probing with progress display\n- Remote installation via cargo binstall (fast) or cargo install (reliable)\n- Leverage existing sync engine for data transfer\n- State persistence for resume capability\n\n## Error Handling Strategy\n\n### SSH Connection Failures\n- **Timeout**: Show as \"unreachable\", allow user to retry or skip\n- **Auth failure**: Show specific error, suggest `ssh-add` if key issue\n- **Host key**: Accept new keys automatically (StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new)\n- **Partial failures**: Continue with working hosts, summarize failures at end\n\n### Installation Failures\n- **No cargo**: Offer binary download alternative\n- **Compilation error**: Show log excerpt, suggest checking dependencies\n- **Disk full**: Detect upfront via probe, warn before attempting\n- **Network timeout**: Installation runs in background, polls for completion\n\n### Indexing Failures\n- **Index timeout**: Runs in background, polls for progress\n- **Partial data**: Warn but continue (better to have some data than none)\n- **Permissions**: Warn if some paths inaccessible\n\n### Config Failures\n- **Invalid TOML**: Validate round-trip before writing\n- **Backup failed**: Abort config write, preserve existing\n- **Merge conflict**: Skip existing sources, show what was skipped\n\n### Recovery\n- All progress saved to `~/.config/cass/setup_state.json`\n- Resume with `cass sources setup --resume`\n- Clear stuck state with `cass sources setup --resume --force`\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n### Many Hosts (50+)\n- Search/filter capability essential\n- Virtual scroll for large lists\n- \"Select first N matching\" for batch operations\n\n### Slow Networks\n- Longer timeouts for overseas hosts\n- Progress indication during long operations\n- Background operations with polling\n\n### Partial Access\n- Some hosts accessible, others not\n- Clear indication of what's working\n- Continue with available hosts\n\n### Existing Configuration\n- Detect already-configured hosts\n- Show differently in UI (grayed out / badge)\n- Don't duplicate, offer to update if wanted\n\n### Mixed cass Versions\n- Remote has older cass than local\n- Warn about potential compatibility issues\n- Offer to upgrade remote\n\n### No Agent Data Found\n- Host reachable but no session data detected\n- Still allow configuration (user may know of custom paths)\n- Lower in selection priority\n\n### Interrupted Setup\n- Ctrl+C during probe: Safe, nothing changed\n- Ctrl+C during install: State saved, resume continues\n- Ctrl+C during config: State saved, resume skips install\n- Ctrl+C during sync: Partial sync, re-run completes\n\n### Concurrent Runs\n- Lock file prevents concurrent setup runs\n- Clear error message if locked\n\n## Success Metrics\n- Time to first cross-machine search: < 5 minutes from fresh install\n- Zero manual file editing required\n- Works with any SSH-accessible machine\n- 90%+ of users succeed without consulting docs\n\n## Dependencies\n- Existing SSH config discovery (done)\n- Existing sync engine with tilde expansion (done)\n- Interactive TUI crate (to be added - see subtask tlk6)\n\n## Out of Scope (Future Work)\n- Windows remote support (SSH on Windows is complex)\n- Non-SSH transports (HTTP API, etc.)\n- Automatic periodic sync scheduling\n- Remote machine auto-discovery (mDNS, etc.)\n- GUI/web interface\n\n## Subtasks\n1. **tlk6**: Add dialoguer crate for interactive TUI\n2. **vxe2**: Implement SSH host probing for cass status\n3. **rnjt**: Build interactive host selection UI\n4. **o6ax**: Implement remote cass installation via SSH\n5. **x4sj**: Implement remote index triggering\n6. **wygt**: Auto-configure sources.toml from selection\n7. **dbdl**: Implement 'cass sources setup' command (orchestrator)\n8. **jjal**: Add unit and integration tests\n9. **22j1**: Update documentation\n\nLabels: [epic sources ux]","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-05T13:04:51.035435Z","created_by":"jemanuel","updated_at":"2026-01-05T22:52:57.850699Z","closed_at":"2026-01-05T22:52:57.850699Z","close_reason":"All subtasks complete: tlk6 (dialoguer), vxe2 (probing), rnjt (selection UI), o6ax (install), x4sj (indexing), wygt (config), dbdl (setup command), jjal (tests), 22j1 (docs)","compaction_level":0,"labels":["epic","sources","ux"]}

The Master E2E suite verifies:\n- All components integrate correctly\n- Real-world workflows complete successfully\n- Performance meets requirements\n- Edge cases are handled\n- Regressions are caught before release\n\n## Test Suite Structure\n\n### Test Configuration\n\n```rust\n// tests/e2e/config.rs\nuse std::path::PathBuf;\n\npub struct E2EConfig {\n    pub test_data_dir: PathBuf,\n    pub

{"id":"coding_agent_session_search-ifr7","title":"[P0] Opt 2: SIMD Dot Product Implementation","description":"# Optimization 2: SIMD Dot Product Implementation\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nAfter F16 pre-conversion (Optimization 1), the remaining hotspot is the scalar dot product loop. Even with LLVM's auto-vectorization, explicit SIMD can provide guaranteed vectorization and better instruction scheduling.\n\n### Current Implementation (vector_index.rs:1221-1228)\n```rust\nfn dot_product(a: &[f32], b: &[f32]) -> f32 {\n    a.iter().zip(b.iter()).map(|(x, y)| x * y).sum()\n}\n```\n\n### Why Explicit SIMD?\n- LLVM auto-vectorization is not guaranteed - depends on optimization level, alignment, loop structure\n- Explicit SIMD provides predictable, measurable performance\n- AVX2 processes 8 floats per instruction (256-bit registers)\n- SSE processes 4 floats per instruction (128-bit registers)\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nUse the `wide` crate for portable SIMD that works across x86_64 (AVX2/SSE) and ARM (NEON).\n\n### Implementation Location\n- File: `src/search/vector_index.rs`\n- Add new function: `dot_product_simd`\n- Modify `dot_product_at` to use SIMD version\n\n### Code Implementation\n```rust\nuse wide::f32x8;\n\nfn dot_product_simd(a: &[f32], b: &[f32]) -> f32 {\n    let chunks_a = a.chunks_exact(8);\n    let chunks_b = b.chunks_exact(8);\n    let remainder_a = chunks_a.remainder();\n    let remainder_b = chunks_b.remainder();\n\n    let mut sum = f32x8::ZERO;\n    for (ca, cb) in chunks_a.zip(chunks_b) {\n        let arr_a: [f32; 8] = ca.try_into().unwrap();\n        let arr_b: [f32; 8] = cb.try_into().unwrap();\n        sum += f32x8::from(arr_a) * f32x8::from(arr_b);\n    }\n\n    let mut scalar_sum: f32 = sum.reduce_add();\n    for (a, b) in remainder_a.iter().zip(remainder_b) {\n        scalar_sum += a * b;\n    }\n    scalar_sum\n}\n```\n\n### Why `wide` Crate?\n- Version 0.7.x is stable and maintained\n- Provides `f32x8::ZERO` for zero-initialization\n- Provides `reduce_add()` for horizontal sum\n- Portable across x86_64 and ARM\n- No unsafe code in user code\n\n## Isomorphism Note\n\n**Important**: SIMD reorders floating-point operations, causing ~1e-7 relative error in scores.\n\n### Why This Is Acceptable\n- **Ranking order is preserved**: Score differences are too small to change ordering\n- **Same result set**: Same (message_id, chunk_idx) pairs returned\n- **Industry standard**: All vector search engines accept this trade-off\n\n### Verification\n```rust\n// Property test\nfor query in test_queries {\n    let scalar = dot_product(&a, &b);\n    let simd = dot_product_simd(&a, &b);\n    assert!((scalar - simd).abs() < 1e-5 * scalar.abs().max(1.0));\n}\n```\n\n## Pre-Implementation Verification\n\nBefore implementing explicit SIMD, verify LLVM isn't already auto-vectorizing:\n```bash\nRUSTFLAGS=\"--emit=asm\" cargo build --release\n# Check target/release/deps/*.s for vmulps/vaddps (AVX) or mulps/addps (SSE)\n```\n\nIf auto-vectorization is already happening, explicit SIMD may provide marginal benefit. Benchmark to verify.\n\n## Expected Impact\n\n| Metric | Before (post-Opt1) | After |\n|--------|-------------------|-------|\n| `vector_index_search_50k` | ~30ms | 10-15ms |\n| Speedup | Baseline | 2-4x |\n\n## Cargo.toml Addition\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nwide = \"0.7\"  # Portable SIMD\n```\n\n## Rollback Strategy\n\nEnvironment variable `CASS_SIMD_DOT=0` to:\n- Disable SIMD implementation\n- Fall back to scalar dot product\n- Useful for debugging FP precision issues\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- **Depends on**: Optimization 1 (F16 Pre-Convert) - SIMD on uniform F32 is simpler and faster\n- **Blocks**: Optimization 3 (Parallel) - Parallelizing fast SIMD ops yields best results","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-10T02:41:48.349307503Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-10T06:39:02.441031765Z","closed_at":"2026-01-10T06:39:02.441031765Z","close_reason":"Implemented SIMD dot product optimization achieving 2.7x additional speedup (16ms → 6ms).

time\n- [ ] Correct Unicode handling maintained\n- [ ] All highlight positions are valid (within text bounds)\n- [ ] Overlapping highlights are properly merged\n- [ ] Property tests verify match correctness\n- [ ] Memory usage acceptable (Arc<str> overhead)\n\n## Considerations\n- **Memory tradeoff:** Storing both original and lowercase doubles string memory\n- **Arc<str>:** Enables efficient cloning without deep copy\n- **Unicode edge cases:** Some characters change byte length when lowercased\n- **QueryMatcher reuse:** Same query should reuse QueryMatcher across results\n- **Lazy lowercasing:** Could compute lowercase on first access if memory is tight\n\n## Related Files\n- src/search/query.rs (implementation)\n- src/ui/tui.rs (snippet display)\n- tests/case_folded_text.rs

SSH config files\n  - `basic.config` - Simple host definitions\n  - `wildcard.config` - Hosts with wildcards (should be filtered)\n  - `many_hosts.config` - 50+ hosts for performance testing\n- `probe_outputs/` - Sample probe outputs\n  - `cass_installed.txt`\n  - `cass_not_found.txt`\n  - `partial_agents.txt`\n  - `resource_info.txt`\n- `sources_configs/` - Sample sources.toml configs\n  - `empty.toml`\n  - `existing_sources.toml`\n  - `invalid.toml` - For error handling tests\n- `mock_responses/` - Canned SSH responses\n  - `install_success.txt`\n  - `install_failure.txt`\n  - `index_progress.txt`\n\n## Manual Test Plan (Interactive Elements)\nSince dialoguer interactions can't be fully automated:\n\n### Pre-release checklist:\n```\n[ ] Fresh setup (no sources.toml)\n    [ ] Run `cass sources setup`\n    [ ] Verify hosts are discovered from ~/.ssh/config\n    [ ] Verify probe status shown correctly\n    [ ] Test search filtering (type letters, verify filter)\n    [ ] Test select all / deselect all (a / n keys)\n    [ ] Test space to toggle, enter to confirm\n    [ ] Verify config preview is accurate\n    [ ] Test \"Edit paths\" customization\n    [ ] Test \"Add custom path\" flow\n    [ ] Confirm save creates correct sources.toml\n\n[ ] Existing config (some sources already configured)\n    [ ] Verify already-configured hosts shown differently\n    [ ] Verify skip message for existing sources\n    [ ] Verify new sources merge correctly\n    [ ] Verify backup created\n\n[ ] Resume capability\n    [ ] Start setup, Ctrl+C during probe phase\n    [ ] Run setup again with --resume\n    [ ] Verify resumes from correct point\n\n[ ] Non-interactive mode\n    [ ] Run `cass sources setup --non-interactive --hosts css,csd`\n    [ ] Verify no prompts\n    [ ] Verify output is machine-parseable\n\n[ ] Error scenarios\n    [ ] Test with unreachable host (should show error, continue others)\n    [ ] Test with SSH key not loaded (should fail gracefully)\n    [ ] Test with no cargo on remote (should suggest manual install)\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] >80% code coverage for new modules\n- [ ] All error paths have tests\n- [ ] Integration test for happy path\n- [ ] Integration tests for key failure modes\n- [ ] Resume functionality tested\n- [ ] Snapshot tests for config generation\n- [ ] Performance test for parallel probing\n- [ ] SSH layer abstracted for mocking\n- [ ] Tests run in CI without real SSH\n- [ ] Manual test plan documented and executed\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires: All component tasks to be implemented first\n\n## Considerations\n- Testing SSH is inherently tricky (requires mock or real server)\n- Consider testcontainers for SSH integration tests in CI\n- SSH layer must be mockable via trait (design requirement)\n- insta crate for snapshot testing\n- Manual test plan should be run before each release\n\nLabels: [sources

I/O Profiling with strace (Section 3.2)\n\n**Indexing syscalls** (should match these patterns):\n```bash\nstrace -c ./target/release/cass index --full 2>&1\n```\nExpected:\n- `futex`: ~22,689\n- `pwrite64`: ~31,443\n- `pread64`: ~9,109\n- `openat`: ~3,330\n- `fdatasync`: ~194\n\n**Search syscalls** (200 runs of substring wildcard):\nExpected per-run:\n- `openat`: ~121\n- `mmap`: ~340\n- `munmap`: ~242\n\n### 3. Allocation Profiling (Section 3.3)\n\nUsing jemalloc profiling:\n```bash\nMALLOC_CONF=prof:true,prof_prefix:jeprof ./target/release/cass index --full\njeprof --svg ./target/release/cass jeprof.*.heap > alloc_profile.svg\n```\n\nExpected total allocation for 36k messages: ~1,375 MB\nMajor buckets:\n- Rust vec growth\n- SQLite allocation\n- Edge-ngrams generation\n\n## Validation Checklist\n\n- [ ] CPU profile matches expected hotspots (within 20%)\n- [ ] I/O profile matches expected syscall patterns\n- [ ] Allocation profile identifies same buckets\n- [ ] No new unexpected hotspots have emerged\n- [ ] Profiling data is from current codebase version\n\n## If Profiles Don't Match\n\nIf profiles have changed significantly:\n1.

{"id":"coding_agent_session_search-kzxu1","title":"Design in-memory aggregation for batched stats updates","description":"## Design: In-Memory Aggregation for Batched Daily Stats Updates\n\n### Problem\nThe `daily_stats` table is not updated during batch indexing because `update_daily_stats_in_tx` is never called from `insert_conversations_batched`. A naive per-conversation approach would cause N×4 DB writes (N+1 anti-pattern).\n\n### Solution Overview\n1. **StatsAggregator struct**: Accumulates deltas keyed by (day_id, agent, source) during batch processing\n2. **expand() method**: Generates 4 permutations per raw entry at flush time\n3. **update_daily_stats_batched()**: Flushes aggregated data via single multi-value INSERT...ON CONFLICT\n\n### Data Structures\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Clone, Debug, Default)]\npub struct StatsDelta {\n    pub session_count_delta: i64,\n    pub message_count_delta: i64,\n    pub total_chars_delta: i64,\n}\n\npub struct StatsAggregator {\n    deltas: HashMap<(i64, String, String), StatsDelta>,\n}\n\nimpl StatsAggregator {\n    pub fn new() -> Self;\n    pub fn record(&mut self, agent: &str, source: &str, day_id: i64, msgs: i64, chars: i64);\n    pub fn expand(&self) -> Vec<((i64, Cow<'static, str>, Cow<'static, str>), StatsDelta)>;\n    pub fn is_empty(&self) -> bool;\n}\n```\n\n### Flush Strategy\n- Batch SIZE: 100 rows per INSERT statement\n- Uses `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET col = col + excluded.col`\n- Single transaction wraps all chunks\n\n### Integration Point\nHook into `indexer::ingest_batch` after `persist_conversations_batched`:\n1. Create StatsAggregator\n2. Record each conversation's stats\n3. Call storage.update_daily_stats_batched(aggregator.expand())\n\n### Performance Analysis\n- **Before**: 100 convs × 4 writes = 400 statements\n- **After**: ~4-20 expanded keys in 1 transaction\n- **Expected**: 10-50x reduction in DB round trips\n\n### File Locations\n- `StatsAggregator`: src/storage/sqlite.rs (inline) or new stats_aggregator.rs\n- `update_daily_stats_batched`: src/storage/sqlite.rs\n- Integration: src/indexer/mod.rs::ingest_batch\n\n### Testing (for kzxu.2/kzxu.3)\n1.

{"id":"coding_agent_session_search-lxn5","title":"[P1] Opt 3: Parallel Vector Search with Rayon","description":"# Optimization 3: Parallel Vector Search with Rayon\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nAfter F16 pre-conversion and SIMD optimization, vector search takes ~10-15ms for 50k vectors. This is still dominated by the O(n×d) linear scan - we're just doing it faster. Parallelization can provide near-linear speedup on multi-core systems.\n\n### Current Implementation (vector_index.rs:773-803)\n```rust\n// O(n) scan over ALL vectors - SINGLE THREADED\nfor row in &self.rows {\n    if let Some(filter) = filter && !filter.matches(row) { continue; }\n    let score = self.dot_product_at(row.vec_offset, query_vec)?;\n    heap.push(std::cmp::Reverse(ScoredEntry { score, ... }));\n    if heap.len() > k { heap.pop(); }\n}\n```\n\n### Why Rayon?\n- Already a dependency in CASS (zero new deps)\n- Work-stealing scheduler handles load balancing\n- `par_chunks` provides natural data partitioning\n- Thread-local heaps avoid contention\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nParallel scan with thread-local heaps, merging results at the end.\n\n### Implementation Location\n- File: `src/search/vector_index.rs`\n- Add new function: `search_top_k_parallel`\n- Modify `search_top_k` to dispatch based on index size\n\n### Code Implementation\n```rust\nuse rayon::prelude::*;\n\nconst PARALLEL_THRESHOLD: usize = 10_000;  // Skip parallelism for small indices\n\npub fn search_top_k_parallel(\n    &self,\n    query_vec: &[f32],\n    k: usize,\n    filter: Option<&SemanticFilter>,\n) -> Result<Vec<VectorSearchResult>> {\n    // Skip parallelism for small indices (Rayon overhead ~1-5µs/task)\n    if self.rows.len() < PARALLEL_THRESHOLD {\n        return self.search_top_k(query_vec, k, filter);\n    }\n\n    let results: Vec<_> = self.rows\n        .par_chunks(1024)  // ~49 chunks for 50k vectors\n        .flat_map(|chunk| {\n            let mut local_heap = BinaryHeap::with_capacity(k + 1);\n            for row in chunk {\n                if let Some(f) = filter && !f.matches(row) { continue;

{"id":"coding_agent_session_search-m7y","title":"P6.2 Apply path mappings at display time","description":"# P6.2 Apply path mappings at INGEST time\n\n## Overview\n**IMPORTANT CHANGE:** Workspace path rewriting must happen at ingest time, not display time.\nThis is critical so that workspace FILTERS work consistently across local and remote sources.\n\n## Why Ingest-Time (not Display-Time)\nIf a user searches with `--workspace=/Users/me/projects/myapp`, they expect to find:\n- Local sessions from `/Users/me/projects/myapp`\n- Remote sessions where the ORIGINAL path was `/home/user/projects/myapp`\n\nIf we only rewrite at display-time, the filter won't match the remote sessions because\nthey're stored with the original path. Ingest-time rewriting ensures filter consistency.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Rewrite During Normalization\nIn the indexer, after connector produces NormalizedConversation:\n```rust\nfn apply_workspace_rewrite(\n    conv: &mut NormalizedConversation,\n    source: &SourceDefinition,\n) {\n    if let Some(ref workspace) = conv.workspace {\n        let rewritten = source.rewrite_path(workspace);\n        if rewritten != *workspace {\n            // Store original in metadata for audit/display\n            conv.metadata.insert(\n                \"workspace_original\".into(),\n                serde_json::Value::String(workspace.clone())\n            );\n            conv.workspace = Some(rewritten);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Storage of Original Path\nIn SQLite, add `workspace_original` column (nullable):\n```sql\nALTER TABLE conversations ADD COLUMN workspace_original TEXT;\n```\n\nIn Tantivy, optionally add `workspace_original` as STORED (not indexed):\n```rust\nschema_builder.add_text_field(\"workspace_original\", STORED);\n```\n\n### CLI/TUI Display\nWhen displaying results, show the rewritten (local) path by default.\nIf user wants to see original, add `--show-original-paths` flag or\nshow on hover/detail view:\n```\nWorkspace: /Users/me/projects/myapp\n           (originally /home/user/projects/myapp on work-laptop)\n```\n\n### Robot Output\nInclude both for machine consumption:\n```json\n{\n  \"workspace\": \"/Users/me/projects/myapp\",\n  \"workspace_original\": \"/home/user/projects/myapp\"\n}\n```\n\n## Filter Behavior After Rewrite\nWith ingest-time rewriting:\n- `cass search --workspace=/Users/me/projects/myapp` finds BOTH local and remote sessions\n- Grouping by workspace works correctly across machines\n- TUI workspace filter shows unified list\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires P6.1 (mapping rules defined)\n- Requires P2.2 (indexer orchestration, where rewrite happens)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Workspace rewritten during indexing, not display\n- [ ] Original path preserved in metadata/column\n- [ ] Workspace filters work across sources\n- [ ] Robot output includes both paths\n- [ ] Re-indexing applies new mappings to existing sessions","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"RedRiver","created_at":"2025-12-16T06:09:36.964081Z","updated_at":"2026-01-02T13:44:58.380515480Z","closed_at":"2025-12-17T07:39:05.921485Z","compaction_level":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"coding_agent_session_search-m7y","depends_on_id":"coding_agent_session_search-1mv","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-16T06:28:39.301008Z","created_by":"jemanuel","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""},{"issue_id":"coding_agent_session_search-m7y","depends_on_id":"coding_agent_session_search-alb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-16T06:11:59.487689Z","created_by":"jemanuel","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""},{"issue_id":"coding_agent_session_search-m7y","depends_on_id":"coding_agent_session_search-rv8","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-16T06:11:54.226254Z","created_by":"jemanuel","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}]}
{"id":"coding_agent_session_search-m86q","title":"[P1] Opt 4: Output-Field Laziness (Skip Unused Stored Fields)","description":"# Optimization 4: Output-Field Laziness\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nProfiling shows `StoreReader::read_block` is a **top hotspot** in CLI-per-search mode. For `--fields minimal` or `--robot-format sessions`, we don't need `content`, `snippet`, or `preview` fields - yet we always load them.\n\n### CPU Profile Evidence (from perf)\n```\n3.44% tantivy::store::reader::StoreReader::read_block (stored field reads)\n```\n\n### Use Cases Where Full Fields Are Unnecessary\n1. `--fields minimal`: Only needs `source_path`, `line_number`, `agent`\n2. `--robot-format sessions`: Only needs unique `source_path` values\n3. `--count-only`: Only needs hit count, no fields at all\n4. TUI list view: Only needs title/preview, not full content\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThread \"requested fields\" through the search pipeline and skip stored field hydration for unrequested fields.\n\n### Implementation Location\n- File: `src/search/query.rs` (SearchClient::search)\n- File: `src/search/tantivy.rs` (hit hydration logic)\n- File: `src/lib.rs` (output formatting)\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n1. **Add FieldMask enum**:\n```rust\n#[derive(Clone, Copy)]\npub enum FieldMask {\n    Full,           // All fields\n    Minimal,        // source_path, line_number, agent only\n    SessionsOnly,   // Just source_path for deduplication\n    CountOnly,      // No fields, just count\n}\n```\n\n2. **Modify SearchClient::search signature**:\n```rust\npub fn search(\n    &self,\n    query: &str,\n    limit: usize,\n    field_mask: FieldMask,  // NEW PARAMETER\n) -> Result<SearchResult>\n```\n\n3. **Conditional field hydration**:\n```rust\n// In hit hydration\nmatch field_mask {\n    FieldMask::Full => {\n        // Load all stored fields (current behavior)\n    }\n    FieldMask::Minimal => {\n        // Skip content, snippet, preview\n        // Only load: source_path, line_number, agent, message_id\n    }\n    FieldMask::SessionsOnly => {\n        // Only load source_path\n    }\n    FieldMask::CountOnly => {\n        // Don't hydrate at all, just count matches\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Isomorphism Proof\n\nThis optimization preserves correctness because:\n1. **Ranking is unchanged**: Scores come from Tantivy BM25, not stored fields\n2. **Hit ordering is unchanged**: Order determined by query execution, not hydration\n3. **Field independence**: Stored fields have no interdependencies\n4. **Output correctness**: Only requested fields matter; others can be omitted\n\n### Formal Property\nIf a field is not requested, not computing it cannot affect:\n- Ranking/ordering (computed from Tantivy scores)\n- Other fields (no dependencies between stored fields)\n\n## Expected Impact\n\n| Scenario | Before | After | Improvement |\n|----------|--------|-------|-------------|\n| `--fields minimal` | 100% stored field reads | ~20% stored field reads | ~5x less I/O |\n| `--robot-format sessions` | Full hydration | Path-only | ~10x less I/O |\n| Cold-open CLI search | Dominated by stored field reads | Much reduced | Noticeable |\n\nThe actual latency improvement depends on:\n- How much of the 3.44% hotspot is skippable\n- I/O vs CPU ratio on target hardware\n- Index file layout (block alignment)\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Backward Compatibility\nNo external API changes needed. Internal refactor only. Default to `FieldMask::Full` for existing callers.\n\n### Threading Through the Stack\nThe field mask needs to propagate:\n1. CLI parsing (`--fields minimal`) → FieldMask\n2. `run_search()` → `SearchClient::search(field_mask)`\n3. `SearchClient` → Tantivy hit hydration\n\n### Already-Shipped Related Work\nThe sessions output short-circuit (`src/lib.rs:3672`) already optimizes the *output* side by computing `BTreeSet<&str>` of source_paths. This optimization extends that pattern to the *input* side (stored field reads).\n\n## Verification Plan\n\n1. **Metamorphic test**: Same hit ordering for Full vs Minimal modes\n2. **Field presence test**: Minimal mode returns correct fields, others are absent\n3. **Benchmark**: Measure stored field read reduction with criterion\n\n## Rollback Strategy\n\nEnvironment variable `CASS_LAZY_FIELDS=0` to:\n- Always hydrate all fields regardless of request\n- Useful for debugging missing field issues\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- None (independent optimization)\n- Can be implemented in parallel with P0 vector optimizations","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-10T03:01:12.249545028Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T07:52:18.139055014Z","closed_at":"2026-01-11T07:52:18.139055014Z","close_reason":"Added FieldMask minimal metamorphic test (ordering + omitted fields) in tests/search_filters.rs","compaction_level":0}

A random 256-bit Data Encryption Key (DEK) encrypts the data\n2. The DEK is encrypted with a Key Encryption Key (KEK) derived from your password\n3. Multiple key slots allow different passwords to decrypt the same data\n\n### Algorithms\n\n| Component | Algorithm | Parameters |\n|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Data Encryption | AES-256-GCM | 96-bit nonce, 128-bit tag |\n| Key Derivation | Argon2id | m={memory}KB, t={iterations}, p={parallelism} |\n| DEK Encryption | AES-256-GCM | Same as data |\n| Nonce Generation | Counter-based | Prevents reuse |\n\n### Key Slots\n\nThis archive has {slot_count} key slot(s):\n{slot_descriptions}\n\nEach slot contains the same DEK encrypted with a different KEK.\n\n## Verification\n\n### Checking Archive Integrity\n\nThe AES-GCM authentication tag ensures:\n- Data has not been modified\n- Decryption used the correct key\n\nIf decryption fails, the archive was either:\n- Corrupted in transit\n- Modified by an attacker\n- Decrypted with wrong key\n\n### Verifying Implementation\n\nThis archive was created with CASS, an open-source tool. You can:\n1. Review the source code at {repo_url}\n2. Verify the implementation uses standard libraries\n3. Audit the cryptographic construction\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Use a strong password**: 16+ characters, or 5+ random words\n2. **Store recovery key safely**: It is the only backup\n3. **Rotate passwords periodically**: Generate new archive with new key\n4. **Limit distribution**: Share URL only with intended recipients\n\n## Contact\n\nFor security issues with CASS, see {repo_url}/security\n\n---\nGenerated by CASS v{version}\n```\n\n### help.html Template\n\nThis is an HTML page embedded in the web viewer:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Help - CASS Archive</title>\n    <style>\n        /* Embedded styles - no external dependencies */\n        body { font-family: system-ui, sans-serif; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px; }\n        h1, h2, h3 { color: #333; }\n        code { background: #f4f4f4; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 3px; }\n        .warning { background: #fff3cd; padding: 10px; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; }\n        .info { background: #cce5ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 4px solid #007bff; }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Help</h1>\n    \n    <h2>Accessing the Archive</h2>\n    <p>Enter your password in the unlock screen.

For example:\n- `é` (U+00E9) = precomposed\n- `e` + `́` (U+0065 + U+0301) = decomposed\n\nNFC must see both codepoints before deciding on output. This requires buffering the entire string.\n\n**Mitigation**: NFC is typically cheap (~100-200µs for long messages). The savings come from eliminating the other 3-4 allocations.\n\n## Expected Impact\n\n| Metric | Before | After |\n|--------|--------|-------|\n| `canonicalize_long_message` | 951 µs | ~300 µs |\n| Allocations per call | 5 | 2 |\n| Index-time impact | Noticeable | Reduced |\n\n**Note**: This only affects index-time, not query-time. Lexical search doesn't use canonicalization.\n\n## Impact on Semantic Search Query Path\n\nThe query embedding path also calls `canonicalize_for_embedding` on the query text. Queries are typically short, so the impact is minimal. But the optimization applies equally.\n\n## Isomorphism Proof\n\nThe streaming version must produce byte-for-byte identical output:\n1. **Same NFC normalization**: Same input → same NFC output\n2. **Same markdown stripping**: Same rules, different implementation\n3. **Same whitespace normalization**: Collapse runs, preserve word boundaries\n4. **Same low-signal filtering**: Same heuristics\n5. **Same truncation**: Same MAX_EMBED_CHARS limit\n\n### Verification\n```rust\n#[test]\nfn streaming_matches_original() {\n    for text in test_corpus() {\n        let original = canonicalize_for_embedding(text);\n        let streaming = canonicalize_for_embedding_streaming(text);\n        assert_eq!(original, streaming, \"Mismatch for: {:?}\", text);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Verification Plan\n\n1. **Equivalence test**: Original vs streaming produce identical output for test corpus\n2. **content_hash test**: Hash of canonicalized output matches\n3. **Benchmark**: Measure allocation reduction with criterion\n4. **Property-based test**: Fuzz with arbitrary Unicode strings\n\n## Rollback Strategy\n\nEnvironment variable `CASS_STREAMING_CANONICALIZE=0` to:\n- Use original multi-allocation implementation\n- Useful for debugging canonicalization issues\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- None (index-time optimization, independent of search path)\n- Can be implemented in parallel with vector search optimizations","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-10T03:02:10.211219839Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-10T03:40:06.524555416Z","closed_at":"2026-01-10T03:40:06.524555416Z","close_reason":"Duplicate of 5p55 - consolidated","compaction_level":0}

{"id":"coding_agent_session_search-o6ax","title":"Implement remote cass installation via SSH","description":"# Implement remote cass installation via SSH\n\n## What\nAutomatically install cass on remote machines that don't have it, via SSH.\nSupport multiple installation methods with intelligent fallback and robust\nhandling of long-running installations.\n\n## Why\nThe biggest friction in multi-machine cass usage is getting cass installed \neverywhere. Users shouldn't have to:\n1. SSH to each machine manually\n2. Figure out how to install Rust/cargo\n3. Wait for cargo install to complete\n4. Handle compilation failures\n\nAutomating this transforms a 30-minute multi-machine setup into a 5-minute \nguided process.\n\n## Installation Methods (Priority Order)\n\nSelection is automatic based on what's available on the remote:\n\n### 1. Cargo Binstall (Fastest if available)\n```bash\ncargo binstall --no-confirm coding-agent-search\n```\n- **When**: cargo-binstall is installed\n- **Time**: ~30 seconds\n- **Reliability**: High (downloads pre-built binary via cargo)\n\n### 2. Pre-built Binary (Fast, no cargo needed)\n```bash\nARCH=$(uname -m)\ncurl -fsSL \"https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/releases/latest/download/cass-linux-${ARCH}\" -o ~/.local/bin/cass\nchmod +x ~/.local/bin/cass\n```\n- **When**: Pre-built binary exists for this arch AND curl/wget available\n- **Time**: ~10 seconds\n- **Reliability**: Medium (requires release publishing)\n\n### 3. Cargo Install (Most reliable fallback)\n```bash\ncargo install coding-agent-search\n```\n- **When**: cargo exists, other methods unavailable/failed\n- **Time**: 2-5 minutes (compilation)\n- **Reliability**: High (builds from source)\n\n### 4. Full Bootstrap (Last resort)\n```bash\n# Install rustup\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\nsource ~/.cargo/env\ncargo install coding-agent-search\n```\n- **When**: No cargo, user explicitly confirms\n- **Time**: 5-10 minutes\n- **Reliability**: High (but changes system)\n\n## Critical: Long-Running Installation Handling\n\nCargo install can take 5+ minutes. SSH sessions may timeout. Solution:\n\n### Background Execution with Polling\n```bash\n# Start installation in background with nohup\nnohup bash -c 'cargo install coding-agent-search > ~/.cass_install.log 2>&1 && echo DONE >> ~/.cass_install.log' &\nINSTALL_PID=$!\necho \"INSTALL_PID=$INSTALL_PID\"\n\n# Polling script (run separately)\ntail -f ~/.cass_install.log | while read line; do\n    echo \"$line\"\n    [[ \"$line\" == \"DONE\" ]] && break\ndone\n```\n\n### Implementation\n```rust\npub struct RemoteInstaller {\n    host: String,\n    system_info: SystemInfo,\n    resources: ResourceInfo,\n    local_cass_version: String,  // For version matching\n}\n\npub enum InstallMethod {\n    CargoBinstall,\n    PrebuiltBinary { url: String, checksum: Option<String> },\n    CargoInstall,\n    FullBootstrap,  // Includes rustup installation\n}\n\npub struct InstallProgress {\n    pub stage: InstallStage,\n    pub message: String,\n    pub percent: Option<u8>,\n}\n\npub enum InstallStage {\n    Preparing,\n    Downloading,\n    Compiling { crate_name: String },\n    Installing,\n    Verifying,\n    Complete,\n    Failed { error: String },\n}\n\nimpl RemoteInstaller {\n    /// Choose best installation method based on system info\n    pub fn choose_method(&self) -> InstallMethod {\n        if self.system_info.has_cargo_binstall {\n            return InstallMethod::CargoBinstall;\n        }\n        \n        if let Some(url) = self.get_prebuilt_url() {\n            return InstallMethod::PrebuiltBinary { url, checksum: None };\n        }\n        \n        if self.system_info.has_cargo {\n            return InstallMethod::CargoInstall;\n        }\n        \n        InstallMethod::FullBootstrap\n    }\n    \n    /// Check if resources are sufficient for compilation\n    pub fn can_compile(&self) -> Result<(), InstallError> {\n        if self.resources.disk_available_mb < 2048 {\n            return Err(InstallError::InsufficientDisk {\n                available_mb: self.resources.disk_available_mb,\n                required_mb: 2048,\n            });\n        }\n        if self.resources.memory_available_mb < 1024 {\n            return Err(InstallError::InsufficientMemory {\n                available_mb: self.resources.memory_available_mb,\n                required_mb: 1024,\n            });\n        }\n        Ok(())\n    }\n    \n    /// Install cass on remote, streaming progress\n    pub async fn install(\n        &self,\n        on_progress: impl Fn(InstallProgress),\n    ) -> Result<InstallResult, InstallError> {\n        let method = self.choose_method();\n        \n        on_progress(InstallProgress {\n            stage: InstallStage::Preparing,\n            message: format!(\"Installing via {:?}\", method),\n            percent: Some(0),\n        });\n        \n        match method {\n            InstallMethod::CargoBinstall => self.install_via_binstall(on_progress).await,\n            InstallMethod::PrebuiltBinary { url, checksum } => {\n                self.install_via_binary(&url, checksum.as_deref(), on_progress).await\n            }\n            InstallMethod::CargoInstall => self.install_via_cargo(on_progress).await,\n            InstallMethod::FullBootstrap => self.install_with_bootstrap(on_progress).await,\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Streaming Output Display\n```\nInstalling cass on yto...\n  Method: cargo install (cargo-binstall not available)\n  ✓ Resource check passed (89GB disk, 4GB RAM)\n  \n  Updating crates.io index... done\n  Downloading 127 crates...     ████████████████████░░░░ 85%\n  Compiling libc v0.2.155\n  Compiling cfg-if v1.0.0\n  Compiling unicode-ident v1.0.12\n  ...

Pre-computing u64 hash\nand comparing hashes first is faster for the common \"not equal\" case.\n\n## Location\n- **File:** src/storage/sqlite.rs\n- **Lines:** Schema detection/validation, migration checks\n\n## Current State\n\\`\\`\\`rust\nconst EXPECTED_SCHEMA_HASH: &str = \"a1b2c3d4e5f6...\"; // 64 hex chars\n\nfn needs_migration(conn: &Connection) -> Result<bool> {\n    let current_hash: String = conn.query_row(\n        \"SELECT schema_hash FROM meta\",\n        [],\n        |row| row.get(0)\n    )?;\n    \n    Ok(current_hash != EXPECTED_SCHEMA_HASH)\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Problem Analysis\n1. **String comparison:** 64-byte hex string comparison is O(64)\n2. **Common case:** Schema usually matches (no migration needed)\n3. **Repeated checks:** Schema checked on every DB open\n4. **Memory:** Full string comparison touches 128 bytes\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\\`\\`\\`rust\nuse std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};\nuse std::collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher;\n\n/// Pre-compute u64 hash at compile time\nconst EXPECTED_SCHEMA_HASH: &str = \"a1b2c3d4e5f6...\";\n\n/// Fast u64 hash of the expected schema hash (computed at startup)\nstatic EXPECTED_HASH_U64: once_cell::sync::Lazy<u64> = \n    once_cell::sync::Lazy::new(|| hash_str(EXPECTED_SCHEMA_HASH));\n\nfn hash_str(s: &str) -> u64 {\n    let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new();\n    s.hash(&mut hasher);\n    hasher.finish()\n}\n\nfn schema_matches(current: &str) -> bool {\n    // Fast path: compare u64 hash first (8 bytes vs 64 bytes)\n    let current_hash = hash_str(current);\n    if current_hash != *EXPECTED_HASH_U64 {\n        return false;  // Definitely different\n    }\n    \n    // Slow path: verify string equality (handles hash collision)\n    current == EXPECTED_SCHEMA_HASH\n}\n\nfn needs_migration(conn: &Connection) -> Result<bool> {\n    let current: String = conn.query_row(\n        \"SELECT schema_hash FROM meta\",\n        [],\n        |row| row.get(0)\n    )?;\n    \n    Ok(!schema_matches(&current))\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Why This Works\n- **Fast path (99.9%+):** u64 comparison is single instruction\n- **Hash collisions:** ~1 in 2^64 for random strings, verified by string compare\n- **No false positives:** String comparison catches any hash collision\n- **No false negatives:** If hashes match, strings are compared anyway\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. [ ] Add hash_str helper function\n2. [ ] Add EXPECTED_HASH_U64 lazy static\n3. [ ] Implement schema_matches function\n4. [ ] Update needs_migration to use new function\n5.

Using a two-phase parsing strategy with serde_json::RawValue\nfor deferred fields provides 15-30% improvement for queries accessing partial data.\n\n## Location\n- **File:** src/storage/sqlite.rs\n- **Lines:** ~300-350 (metadata parsing in search result hydration)\n- **Related:** ConversationMetadata struct, search result construction\n\n## Current Implementation\n```rust\nlet metadata: ConversationMetadata = serde_json::from_str(&json_str)?;\n// All 15+ fields parsed even if we only need timestamp + agent_type\n```\n\n## Problem Analysis\n1. **Full parse always:** Every JSON field is deserialized regardless of usage\n2. **Hot path impact:** Called for every search result (often 100+)\n3. **Memory pressure:** Full struct allocation even for list views\n4. **Redundant work:** TUI list only shows source_path, timestamp, agent\n\n## Field Usage Analysis (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)\nBefore implementing, audit actual field access patterns:\n\n| Field | List View | Detail View | Export | Filter |\n|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|--------|\n| source_path | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n| agent_type | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n| timestamp | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n| line_number | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |\n| content_preview | ✓ | | ✓ | |\n| full_content | | ✓ | ✓ | |\n| tool_calls | | ✓ | ✓ | |\n| token_count | | ✓ | ✓ | |\n| model | | ✓ | ✓ | |\n| ... | | | | |\n\n## Proposed Solution\n```rust\nuse serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};\nuse serde_json::value::RawValue;\nuse std::sync::Arc;\n\n/// Core metadata fields - always parsed immediately\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, Deserialize)]\npub struct CoreMetadata {\n    pub source_path: String,\n    pub agent_type: String,\n    pub timestamp: i64,\n    pub line_number: Option<u32>,\n}\n\n/// Full metadata with lazy parsing for expensive fields\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub struct LazyMetadata {\n    /// Core fields parsed immediately\n    pub core: CoreMetadata,\n    /// Raw JSON for deferred parsing\n    raw_json: Arc<str>,\n    /// Cached full parse (populated on first access)\n    full_cache: OnceCell<FullMetadata>,\n}\n\nimpl LazyMetadata {\n    /// Parse from JSON string\n    pub fn from_json(json: &str) -> Result<Self, serde_json::Error> {\n        let core: CoreMetadata = serde_json::from_str(json)?;\n        Ok(Self {\n            core,\n            raw_json: Arc::from(json),\n            full_cache: OnceCell::new(),\n        })\n    }\n    \n    /// Get full metadata (parses on first call, cached thereafter)\n    pub fn full(&self) -> Result<&FullMetadata, serde_json::Error> {\n        self.full_cache.get_or_try_init(|| {\n            serde_json::from_str(&self.raw_json)\n        })\n    }\n    \n    /// Check if full metadata has been accessed\n    pub fn is_full_loaded(&self) -> bool {\n        self.full_cache.get().is_some()\n    }\n}\n\n/// Complete metadata structure\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, Deserialize)]\npub struct FullMetadata {\n    // Include all fields\n    pub source_path: String,\n    pub agent_type: String,\n    pub timestamp: i64,\n    pub line_number: Option<u32>,\n    pub content: Option<String>,\n    pub tool_calls: Option<Vec<ToolCall>>,\n    pub token_count: Option<u32>,\n    pub model: Option<String>,\n    // ... all other fields\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. [ ] **Audit field access:** Instrument current code to log which fields are accessed per operation\n2. [ ] **Define field tiers:** \n   - Tier 1 (always): source_path, agent_type, timestamp, line_number\n   - Tier 2 (on-demand): content, tool_calls, token_count, model, etc.\n3. [ ] **Implement LazyMetadata:** With OnceCell for cached full parse\n4. [ ] **Update callsites:** Replace ConversationMetadata with LazyMetadata\n5. [ ] **Add access logging:** Track lazy vs eager parse ratio\n6. [ ] **Benchmark:** Compare parse times for list vs detail views\n7. [ ] **Verify correctness:** All functionality unchanged\n\n## Comprehensive Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests (tests/lazy_metadata.rs)\n```rust\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use super::*;\n    \n

Filter by single agent → only that agent's conversations\n2. Filter by multiple agents → union of conversations\n3. Time range filter → only conversations in range\n4. Workspace filter → only matching workspaces\n5. No filters → all conversations\n6. Empty result (no matches) → empty database with schema\n7. PathMode::Hash → paths are opaque SHA256 prefixes\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n- `src/pages/mod.rs` (new)\n- `src/pages/export.rs` (new)\n- `src/lib.rs` (add pages module)\n- `tests/pages_export.rs` (new)\n\n## Exit Criteria\n\n1.

Without virtual scrolling:\n- 10K DOM nodes = ~500MB memory, 2s+ render time\n- Scrolling becomes janky at 1K+ items\n- Mobile devices crash or freeze\n\nVirtual scrolling keeps DOM nodes at O(viewport) instead of O(total).\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### Virtual List Component\n\n```javascript\n// web/src/components/VirtualList.js\n\nexport class VirtualList {\n    constructor({\n

Authentication Errors\n\n```rust\n#[test]\nfn test_wrong_password_error() {\n    let archive = create_test_archive(\"correct-password\");\n    let result = decrypt_archive(&archive, \"wrong-password\");\n    \n    match result {\n        Err(DecryptError::AuthenticationFailed) => {\n            // Good - specific error type\n        }\n        Err(e) => panic!(\"Wrong error type: {:?}\", e),\n        Ok(_) => panic!(\"Should have failed\"),\n    }\n}\n\n#[test]\nfn test_empty_password_error() {\n    let archive = create_test_archive(\"password\");\n    let result = decrypt_archive(&archive, \"\");\n    \n    assert!(matches!(result, Err(DecryptError::EmptyPassword)));\n}\n\n#[test]\nfn test_password_error_timing() {\n    // Verify wrong password doesnt leak timing info\n    let archive = create_test_archive(\"correctpassword123\");\n    \n    let times: Vec<_> = (0..100).map(|i| {\n        let wrong = format!(\"wrongpassword{}\", i);\n        let start = Instant::now();\n        let _ = decrypt_archive(&archive, &wrong);\n        start.elapsed()\n    }).collect();\n    \n    let mean = times.iter().map(|t| t.as_nanos()).sum::<u128>() / times.len() as u128;\n    let variance: f64 = times.iter()\n        .map(|t| (t.as_nanos() as f64 - mean as f64).powi(2))\n        .sum::<f64>() / times.len() as f64;\n    \n    // High variance would indicate timing leak\n    assert!(variance.sqrt() / mean as f64 < 0.3, \"Timing variance too high\");\n}\n```\n\n### 2.

{"id":"coding_agent_session_search-rob","title":"Agent-First CLI Epic: Making cass Irresistible for AI Agents","description":"# Agent-First CLI Epic\n\n## Vision\nTransform `cass` from a good CLI tool into an **exceptional tool for AI agents**. The goal is to make `cass` the gold standard for how CLI tools should be designed for AI consumption.\n\n## Background & Motivation\nAI agents (Claude, GPT-4, Codex, etc.) are increasingly being used to automate software development workflows. These agents interact with CLI tools through subprocess execution, parsing stdout/stderr. However, most CLI tools were designed for human users, creating friction:\n\n1. **Context Window Bloat**: AI agents have limited context windows (4K-200K tokens). A single search returning 10 results with full content can be 50KB+ of text, consuming precious context.\n\n2. **Parsing Uncertainty**: Agents need predictable, machine-readable output. Mixed log messages, inconsistent schemas, and undocumented fields cause parsing failures.\n\n3. **State Blindness**: Agents don't know if the index is stale, if they should retry, or what the system state is.\n\n4. **Workflow Friction**: Multi-step workflows (search → analyze → refine) require verbose command sequences.\n\n## Design Principles\n1. **Context-Efficient by Default**: Every byte of output should earn its place\n2. **Self-Documenting**: The CLI should explain itself completely\n3. **Predictable**: Same inputs → same outputs, documented contracts\n4. **Composable**: Easy to chain operations in workflows\n5. **Fail-Informative**: Errors include actionable recovery information\n\n## Success Metrics\n- 10x reduction in average response size with field selection\n- Zero log pollution in robot mode outputs\n- 100% schema coverage in introspection\n- Sub-second status checks\n\n## Structure\n- rob.ctx: Context Window Management (CRITICAL)\n- rob.query: Query Intelligence\n- rob.state: State Awareness\n- rob.flow: Workflow Optimization\n- rob.api: API Contract Clarity\n- rob.safe: Reliability & Safety\n\n## Dependencies\nThis epic builds on the existing robot mode infrastructure (--json, --robot, robot-docs).

{"id":"coding_agent_session_search-rq7z","title":"[EPIC] Performance Optimization Round 1: Semantic Search 20-30x Speedup","description":"# Performance Optimization Round 1: Semantic Search Pipeline\n\n## Overview\n\nThis epic tracks the implementation of high-impact performance optimizations identified through rigorous profiling and analysis. The primary goal is achieving a **20-30x speedup** on semantic (vector) search while preserving exact search semantics.\n\n## Strategic Context\n\nCASS (Coding Agent Session Search) indexes conversations from Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT, Gemini, Aider, and other coding agents into a unified, searchable index. Performance is critical for:\n- Interactive TUI responsiveness (target: <50ms for any search)\n- Robot mode for AI agents consuming search results programmatically\n- Batch operations like multi-machine sync and bulk indexing\n\n## The Problem: 56ms Vector Search Latency\n\nProfiling revealed the **semantic search path is the primary bottleneck**:\n- `vector_index_search_50k`: **56.1ms** (vs 10.5µs for lexical search)\n- Root cause: O(n×d) linear scan over 50k vectors with 384 dimensions each\n- Additional overhead: F16→F32 conversion per dot product element\n\n## The Solution: Three-Stage Optimization Chain\n\nBy combining three complementary optimizations, we achieve multiplicative speedups:\n\n1. **F16 Pre-Convert** (56ms → 30ms): Eliminate per-query F16→F32 conversion by pre-converting at load time\n2. **SIMD Dot Product** (30ms → 10-15ms): Explicit AVX2/SSE vectorization using `wide` crate\n3. **Parallel Search** (10-15ms → 2-3ms): Rayon parallel scan with thread-local heaps\n\n## Hard Constraints (from AGENTS.md)\n\nAll implementations MUST follow these non-negotiables:\n- NO FILE DELETION without explicit permission\n- Cargo only; Rust edition 2024 nightly\n- After substantive changes: `cargo fmt --check && cargo check --all-targets && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test`\n- One lever per change; no unrelated refactors\n- Include rollback guidance (env vars for each optimization)\n\n## Equivalence Oracle\n\nFor optimization verification, outputs must match:\n1. **Vector search**: Same (message_id, chunk_idx) set returned. Scores may differ by ~1e-7 relative error due to FP reordering with SIMD - acceptable for ranking.\n2. **RRF fusion**: Deterministic tie-breaking by SearchHitKey ordering (already implemented).\n3. **Canonicalization**: Byte-for-byte identical output (test with content_hash).\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n| Metric | Before | After | Validation |\n|--------|--------|-------|------------|\n| `vector_index_search_50k` | 56.1ms | 2-3ms | `cargo bench --bench vector_perf` |\n| Memory (50k F16 vectors) | 38.4 MB | 76.8 MB | Acceptable 2x for 20x speedup |\n| Search results | Baseline | Identical | Equivalence oracle tests |\n\n## Rollback Strategy\n\nEach optimization has an env var to disable:\n- `CASS_F16_PRECONVERT=0`: Keep F16 storage, convert per-query\n- `CASS_SIMD_DOT=0`: Fall back to scalar dot product\n- `CASS_PARALLEL_SEARCH=0`: Use sequential scan\n- `CASS_LAZY_FIELDS=0`: Hydrate all fields regardless of request\n- `CASS_REGEX_CACHE=0`: Disable wildcard regex caching\n- `CASS_STREAMING_CANONICALIZE=0`: Use original canonicalize function\n- `CASS_SQLITE_CACHE=0`: Disable ID caching\n\n## Dependencies and Ordering\n\nThe P0 optimizations form a critical dependency chain:\n- SIMD dot product benefits most AFTER F16 pre-convert (same data type throughout)\n- Parallel search benefits most AFTER SIMD (parallelizing already-fast operation)\n\nP1/P2/P3 optimizations are largely independent and can proceed in parallel.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-10T02:41:00.406693757Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-10T06:53:59.353625464Z","closed_at":"2026-01-10T06:53:59.353625464Z","close_reason":"COMPLETED: Achieved 29x speedup (target was 20-30x).

**Transaction size:** Large transactions hold write lock longer\n- **Memory:** Batch building allocates more memory temporarily\n- **Error handling:** Partial batch failures need proper rollback\n- **WAL mode:** Batching works best with WAL journaling mode\n\n## Related Files\n- src/storage/sqlite.rs (implementation)\n- src/indexer/mod.rs (caller)\n- benches/search_perf.rs (benchmarks)\n-

All exports use chunked AEAD in payload/.\n- config.json is public and contains only parameters (no secrets or labels).\n- index.html must not inline config (CSP stays strict). Config is fetched.\n- integrity.json is public; integrity-fingerprint.txt is a short summary hash for out-of-band verification.\n\n## Builder Responsibilities\n\n1. Create site/ and private/ directories.\n2. Write config.json from encryption pipeline (version, export_id, base_nonce, compression, kdf defaults, payload manifest, key slots, exported_at, cass_version).\n3. Write payload/chunk-*.bin files and optional blobs/ for attachments.\n4. Copy web assets (HTML, JS, CSS, vendor, assets) from web/dist or pages_assets.\n5. Generate integrity.json for all files in site/ and a private integrity-fingerprint.txt.\n6. Write robots.txt and .nojekyll.\n7. Write README.md (public) and private recovery artifacts.\n8. Optional: generate PWA manifest if enabled.\n\n## Security / CSP Requirements\n\n- index.html uses CSP meta tag (no inline scripts, only 'self' and 'wasm-unsafe-eval').\n- No secrets in site/ (no recovery secret, no QR images, no master-key backup).\n- No inline config. All config is read from config.json via fetch.\n\n## Test Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests\n- config.json schema round-trip\n- integrity.json includes all public files, correct hashes and sizes\n- payload manifest count and file names match generated chunks\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Build a small export and assert exact directory tree\n- Verify site/ has no private artifacts\n- Verify optional blobs/ is included only when attachments enabled\n\n### E2E Script\n- Build export -> bundle -> cass pages --verify\n- Optional: start preview server and load auth page\n- Log each check with clear PASS/FAIL markers\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n- src/pages/bundle.rs\n- src/pages/integrity.rs\n- src/pages/assets.rs (copy logic)\n- tests/pages_bundle.rs\n- tests/fixtures/pages_bundle/\n\n## Exit Criteria\n\n1. site/ deploys cleanly on GitHub Pages and Cloudflare Pages\n2. All required files present and integrity.json validates\n3. No secrets in site/\n4. config.json matches encryption output\n5. Chunked payload loads in web viewer\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-07T03:34:00.885932299Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T17:04:34.420767645Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T17:04:34.420767645Z","close_reason":"Implemented BundleBuilder with full functionality: creates site/ and private/ directories, copies encrypted payload, embeds web assets, generates integrity.json with SHA256 hashes, writes robots.txt/.nojekyll, writes private recovery artifacts, integrated with wizard.

Using ArrayVec avoids heap allocation since the maximum count\nis known at compile time, reducing allocator pressure during bulk indexing.\n\n## Location\n- **File:** src/search/tantivy.rs\n- **Lines:** ~150-200 (edge_ngrams function)\n- **Related:** Index building, tokenization pipeline\n\n## Current Implementation\n```rust\nfn edge_ngrams(word: &str) -> Vec<&str> {\n    let mut ngrams = Vec::new();\n    for len in 3..=20 {\n        if word.len() >= len {\n            ngrams.push(&word[..len]);\n        }\n    }\n    ngrams\n}\n```\n\n## Problem Analysis\n1. **Heap allocation:** Vec allocates on heap every call\n2. **Known max size:** At most 18 n-grams (lengths 3 through 20)\n3. **Hot path:** Called for every word during indexing (millions of calls)\n4. **Allocation pressure:** Causes fragmentation and GC-like behavior\n\n## Proposed Solution\n```rust\nuse arrayvec::ArrayVec;\n\n/// Maximum number of edge n-grams per word\n/// Lengths 3..=20 = 18 possible n-grams\nconst MAX_EDGE_NGRAMS: usize = 18;\n\n/// Generate edge n-grams without heap allocation\n/// \n/// # Safety\n/// This function assumes the input is valid UTF-8 that has been\n/// normalized to ASCII or has been checked for valid char boundaries.\n/// \n/// # Example\n/// ```\n/// let ngrams = edge_ngrams_stack(\"hello\");\n/// assert_eq!(ngrams.as_slice(), &[\"hel\", \"hell\", \"hello\"]);\n/// ```\npub fn edge_ngrams_stack(word: &str) -> ArrayVec<&str, MAX_EDGE_NGRAMS> {\n    let mut ngrams = ArrayVec::new();\n    let word_len = word.len();\n    \n    // Early exit for short words\n    if word_len < 3 {\n        return ngrams;\n    }\n    \n    // Generate n-grams from length 3 to min(20, word_len)\n    let max_len = word_len.min(20);\n    for len in 3..=max_len {\n        // SAFETY: We're slicing at byte boundaries.\n        // The input has been ASCII-normalized by the tokenizer,\n        // so all characters are single-byte.\n        // For non-ASCII input, we use char_indices to find safe boundaries.\n        if word.is_ascii() {\n            ngrams.push(&word[..len]);\n        } else {\n            // Safe UTF-8 slicing for non-ASCII\n            if let Some((idx, _)) = word.char_indices().nth(len) {\n                ngrams.push(&word[..idx]);\n            } else if word.chars().count() >= len {\n                // Word has exactly 'len' chars, use entire string\n                ngrams.push(word);\n                break; // No longer n-grams possible\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    ngrams\n}\n\n/// Iterator-based version (alternative, zero allocation)\npub fn edge_ngrams_iter(word: &str) -> impl Iterator<Item = &str> {\n    let word_len = word.len();\n    let max_len = word_len.min(20);\n    \n    (3..=max_len).filter_map(move |len| {\n        if word.is_ascii() {\n            Some(&word[..len])\n        } else {\n            word.char_indices()\n                .nth(len)\n                .map(|(idx, _)| &word[..idx])\n        }\n    })\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. [ ] **Add arrayvec dependency:** `arrayvec = \"*\"` in Cargo.toml\n2. [ ] **Implement edge_ngrams_stack:** With proper UTF-8 handling\n3. [ ] **Add ASCII fast path:** Skip char_indices for ASCII words\n4. [ ] **Benchmark both versions:** ArrayVec vs Iterator\n5. [ ] **Replace in tokenizer:** Update all callsites\n6. [ ] **Profile allocations:** Use DHAT to verify zero heap allocs\n\n## UTF-8 Safety Analysis\nThe current tokenizer normalizes to ASCII/lowercase before n-gram generation.\nHowever, we should handle edge cases:\n\n```rust\n#[test]\nfn test_utf8_safety() {\n    // ASCII - direct slicing safe\n    let ascii_ngrams = edge_ngrams_stack(\"hello\");\n    assert_eq!(ascii_ngrams.len(), 3); // \"hel\", \"hell\", \"hello\"\n    \n    // Multi-byte UTF-8 - must not slice mid-character\n    let utf8_ngrams = edge_ngrams_stack(\"héllo\"); // é is 2 bytes\n    // Should produce valid strings, not panic\n    for ngram in &utf8_ngrams {\n        assert!(ngram.is_ascii() || ngram.chars().count() >= 3);\n    }\n    \n    // CJK - each char is 3 bytes\n    let cjk_ngrams = edge_ngrams_stack(\"你好世界\");\n    for ngram in &cjk_ngrams {\n        assert!(std::str::from_utf8(ngram.as_bytes()).is_ok());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Comprehensive Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests

We need to evaluate:\n\n### Option 1: dialoguer with ANSI pre-formatting\n```rust\nlet items: Vec<String> = hosts.iter().map(|h| {\n    format!(\"{}\\n    {} • {}\\n    {} • {} sessions\\n    {}\",\n        h.name.bold(),\n        h.hostname.dimmed(),\n        h.os.dimmed(),\n        format_cass_status(&h.cass_status),\n        h.session_count,\n        format_agents(&h.detected_agents)\n    )\n}).collect();\n\nMultiSelect::new().items(&items).interact()?\n```\n- **Pro**: We already use dialoguer patterns, consistent with indicatif\n- **Con**: ANSI in items may cause display issues, no built-in search\n\n### Option 2: inquire crate\n```rust\nuse inquire::MultiSelect;\n\nlet items: Vec<HostItem> = hosts.iter().map(|h| HostItem::from(h)).collect();\nMultiSelect::new(\"Select hosts:\", items)\n    .with_formatter(&|opts| format_selected(opts))\n    .with_render_config(render_config())\n    .prompt()?\n```\n- **Pro**: Better item formatting support, built-in filtering\n- **Con**: Different API, another dependency\n\n### Option 3: Custom with ratatui\nBuild custom selection widget using ratatui (tui-rs successor).\n- **Pro**: Complete control, can match exact mockup\n- **Con**: Significant implementation effort, heavy dependency\n\n### Recommendation\nStart with **Option 1 (dialoguer + ANSI)** for simplicity. If that proves \ninsufficient, pivot to Option 2 (inquire). Document this decision.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. Add `dialoguer = \"*\"` to Cargo.toml\n2. Add `console = \"*\"` if not present (dialoguer's styling backend)  \n3. Create proof-of-concept MultiSelect with multi-line ANSI items\n4. Test terminal compatibility (various terminals, sizes)\n5. If PoC fails, evaluate inquire as fallback\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] dialoguer compiles without errors\n- [ ] Proof-of-concept: MultiSelect with 3-4 line items displays correctly\n- [ ] Test in: Terminal.app, iTerm2, VS Code terminal, basic Linux terminal\n- [ ] ANSI colors render correctly in items\n- [ ] Selection indices map correctly to multi-line items\n- [ ] Document any limitations found\n\n## Fallback Plan\nIf dialoguer multi-line items don't work well:\n```toml\n# Alternative\ninquire = \"*\"\n```\nThe inquire crate has native support for custom item rendering.\n\n## Notes\n- dialoguer integrates well with indicatif (already in use for progress bars)\n- Both libraries are actively maintained\n- Either choice should support our needs with different tradeoffs","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-05T13:05:39.704215Z","created_by":"jemanuel","updated_at":"2026-01-05T16:36:15.786128Z","closed_at":"2026-01-05T16:36:15.786128Z","close_reason":"Implemented HostSelector with multi-line ANSI display, confirmation prompts, and 7 passing tests.

{"id":"coding_agent_session_search-tn4t","title":"Vector index operations (read/write/search)","description":"## Purpose\nImplement vector index CRUD operations with crash safety and optimized search.\n\n## Core Operations\n1. **Create**: Build index from embeddings + metadata\n2. **Load**: mmap from disk, validate header CRC32\n3. **Save**: Atomic write (temp → fsync → rename)\n4. **Search**: Brute-force dot product with inline filter\n\n## Atomic Write Pattern\n```rust\nfn save(&self, path: &Path) -> Result<()> {\n    let temp = path.with_extension(\"cvvi.tmp\");\n    let mut f = File::create(&temp)?;\n    self.write_to(&mut f)?;\n    f.sync_all()?;  // fsync file\n    File::open(temp.parent().unwrap())?.sync_all()?;  // fsync dir\n    std::fs::rename(&temp, path)?;  // atomic rename\n}\n```\n\n## f16 Quantization\n- Use half crate for f16 ↔ f32 conversion\n- Quantize on write, dequantize on read\n- Quality loss negligible for cosine similarity\n- Memory: 50k vectors × 384 dim = 36MB (f16) vs 73MB (f32)\n\n## SIMD-Optimized Search (Critical for Performance)\nFor 50k vectors, naive search could take 50-100ms. With SIMD, target <20ms.\n\n**Optimization strategies**:\n1. **Aligned allocation**: Ensure vector slab is 32-byte aligned for AVX\n2. **Contiguous layout**: Store all vectors contiguously for cache efficiency\n3. **Iterator patterns**: Use patterns that auto-vectorize well\n4. **Consider explicit SIMD**: If auto-vectorization insufficient, use `std::simd` (nightly) or `wide` crate\n\n```rust\n// Good: Auto-vectorizes well\nfn dot_product(a: &[f32], b: &[f32]) -> f32 {\n    a.iter().zip(b.iter()).map(|(x, y)| x * y).sum()\n}\n\n// Alternative: Explicit SIMD with wide crate\nfn dot_product_simd(a: &[f32], b: &[f32]) -> f32 {\n    use wide::f32x8;\n    // ... 8-wide SIMD dot product\n}\n```\n\n**Benchmarking required**: Test auto-vectorization vs explicit SIMD on target hardware.\n\n## mmap Loading\nFor large indices (>100MB), use mmap to avoid loading entire file into RAM:\n```rust\nlet mmap = unsafe { Mmap::map(&file)? };\nlet vectors = VectorSlab::from_mmap(&mmap, header.count, header.dimension);\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Roundtrip: save → load preserves all data\n- [ ] Atomic: crash mid-write doesn't corrupt\n- [ ] mmap loading for large indices\n- [ ] f16 vs f32 rankings are equivalent\n- [ ] Search 50k vectors < 20ms (benchmark!)\n- [ ] Vector slab is properly aligned for SIMD\n\n## Depends On\n- sem.vec.fmt (CVVI format)\n- sem.emb.hash (for testing)\n\n## References\n- Plan: Section 5.2-5.4","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"","created_at":"2025-12-19T01:23:48.934808Z","updated_at":"2026-01-05T22:59:36.443150638Z","closed_at":"2026-01-05T16:05:00.314230Z","compaction_level":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"coding_agent_session_search-tn4t","depends_on_id":"coding_agent_session_search-7tsm","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-19T01:29:20.057916Z","created_by":"jemanuel","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""},{"issue_id":"coding_agent_session_search-tn4t","depends_on_id":"coding_agent_session_search-vwxq","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-19T01:29:14.772621Z","created_by":"jemanuel","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}]}

Check VectorRow Definition\n```bash\n# Find VectorRow definition\nrg \"struct VectorRow\" src/\n```\n\n### 2. Verify Trait Implementations\n```rust\n// Add to tests or run in playground\nfn assert_send<T: Send>() {}\nfn assert_sync<T: Sync>() {}\n\n#[test]\nfn vector_row_is_send_sync() {\n    assert_send::<VectorRow>();\n    assert_sync::<VectorRow>();\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Check All Fields\nVectorRow should only contain:\n- Primitive types (u64, u32, f32, etc.) - inherently Send+Sync\n- &str/String - Send+Sync\n- No Rc, RefCell, raw pointers\n\n### 4. Check VectorIndex Sharability\nFor parallel search, we need:\n```rust\n// VectorIndex must be sharable across threads\nfn assert_sync<T: Sync>() {}\nassert_sync::<VectorIndex>();  // Or &VectorIndex must be Send\n```\n\n## Expected Findings\n\nVectorRow likely contains only:\n- `message_id: u64`\n- `chunk_idx: u32`\n- `vec_offset: usize`\n\nAll primitive types = Send + Sync ✓\n\n## Potential Issues\n\nIf VectorRow contains:\n- `Rc<T>` → Not Send, need to use `Arc<T>`\n- `RefCell<T>` → Not Sync, need different design\n- Raw pointer → May need unsafe impl or wrapper\n\n## Document Findings\n\n1. List all fields in VectorRow\n2. Confirm Send+Sync status\n3. Note any required changes\n\n## Validation Checklist\n\n- [ ] VectorRow definition found\n- [ ] All fields enumerated\n- [ ] Send+Sync compile test passes\n- [ ] VectorIndex sharability confirmed\n- [ ] No blocking issues identified\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Requires completion of Opt 2.4 (SIMD benchmarked)\n- This is a prerequisite for Opt 3.2 (implementation)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-10T03:05:55.801628305Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T16:53:57.646457645Z","closed_at":"2026-01-11T16:53:57.646457645Z","close_reason":"Completed","compaction_level":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"coding_agent_session_search-u07k","depends_on_id":"coding_agent_session_search-g5oe","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T03:08:40.259610685Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"","thread_id":""}]}

For K << N,\nquickselect/introselect provides O(N) average vs O(N log N) for full sort.\n\n## Location\n- **File:** src/search/query.rs\n- **Lines:** Result ranking and selection, rrf_fuse_hits function\n- **Related:** RRF fusion, final result selection\n\n## Current Implementation\n\\`\\`\\`rust\nfn top_k(results: Vec<SearchResult>, k: usize) -> Vec<SearchResult> {\n    let mut sorted = results;\n    sorted.sort_by(|a, b| b.score.partial_cmp(&a.score).unwrap());\n    sorted.truncate(k);\n    sorted\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Problem Analysis\n1. **Full sort:** O(N log N) even when K is small\n2. **Typical case:** k=20-50, N=1000-10000\n3. **Wasted work:** Precise ordering beyond top K is unnecessary\n4. **NaN handling:** partial_cmp().unwrap() panics on NaN scores\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\\`\\`\\`rust\nuse std::cmp::Ordering;\n\n/// Compare floats with NaN handling (NaN sorts to end)\nfn cmp_score_desc(a: &SearchResult, b: &SearchResult) -> Ordering {\n    match (a.score.is_nan(), b.score.is_nan()) {\n        (true, true) => Ordering::Equal,\n        (true, false) => Ordering::Greater,  // NaN after real numbers\n        (false, true) => Ordering::Less,\n        (false, false) => b.score.partial_cmp(&a.score).unwrap(),\n    }\n}\n\nfn top_k_quickselect(mut results: Vec<SearchResult>, k: usize) -> Vec<SearchResult> {\n    let n = results.len();\n    \n    // Edge cases\n    if n == 0 {\n        return results;\n    }\n    if n <= k {\n        results.sort_by(cmp_score_desc);\n        return results;\n    }\n    \n    // Threshold: for small N, full sort is faster due to overhead\n    const QUICKSELECT_THRESHOLD: usize = 64;\n    if n < QUICKSELECT_THRESHOLD {\n        results.sort_by(cmp_score_desc);\n        results.truncate(k);\n        return results;\n    }\n    \n    // Partition to find top K (unordered) in O(N)\n    results.select_nth_unstable_by(k - 1, cmp_score_desc);\n    \n    // Truncate to top K, then sort just those in O(K log K)\n    results.truncate(k);\n    results.sort_by(cmp_score_desc);\n    \n    results\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Why This Works\n- **select_nth_unstable_by:** O(N) average to partition around Kth element\n- **truncate:** O(1) to discard elements beyond K\n- **Final sort:** O(K log K) to order just the top K\n- **Total:** O(N + K log K) vs O(N log N) for full sort\n- **Savings:** When K=25, N=10000: ~3x faster\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. [ ] Add NaN-safe score comparison function\n2. [ ] Implement quickselect-based top_k\n3. [ ] Add threshold tuning based on benchmarks\n4. [ ] Update rrf_fuse_hits to use new function\n5. [ ] Verify result ordering is correct\n6.

improvement when K << N (K=25, N>1000)\n- No regression for small N (threshold handles this)\n- Identical results to full sort (verified by equivalence tests)\n- Correct handling of NaN scores\n- Correct handling of duplicate scores\n\n## Considerations\n- **select_nth_unstable_by:** O(N) average, O(N²) worst case (rare)\n- **Threshold:** If N < 64, just sort (overhead)\n- **NaN handling:** NaN scores sorted to end, not panicking\n- **Stability:** Results are sorted, but order of equal scores not guaranteed\n- **Memory:** In-place, no additional allocation\n\n## Dependencies\n- Rust std (select_nth_unstable_by available since Rust 1.49)\n- No additional dependencies\n\n## Related Files\n- src/search/query.rs (top-k selection)\n- src/search/query.rs (rrf_fuse_hits function)\n-

Define probe result types in sources/probe.rs\n2. Create PROBE_SCRIPT constant with comprehensive bash script\n3. Implement single-host probe function with script injection\n4. Implement output parser (key=value format)\n5. Implement parallel probing with progress callback\n6. Add caching layer\n7. Integrate with existing DiscoveredHost struct\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Single SSH session per host (not multiple commands)\n- [ ] Detects cass installation AND index status\n- [ ] Detects all supported agent data directories\n- [ ] Gets disk space available for installation decision\n- [ ] Gets memory for compilation feasibility check\n- [ ] Respects SSH config (Port, User, IdentityFile, ProxyJump)\n- [ ] Parallel probing with real-time progress (< 10s for 5 hosts)\n- [ ] Results cached for 5 minutes\n- [ ] Graceful handling of unreachable hosts\n\n## Edge Cases\n- Host in SSH config but key not loaded in ssh-agent → mark unreachable\n- Host requires password (BatchMode fails) → mark unreachable with clear message\n- Host has cass but broken/unrunnable → detect via version check failure\n- Very slow connections → respect per-host timeout, don't block others\n- Hosts behind ProxyJump → should work if SSH config is correct\n- Host with < 1GB disk → flag as can_compile=false\n- Host with < 2GB memory → warn about potential OOM during cargo install\n\n## Testing\n- Unit tests with mock probe output parsing\n- Integration test: probe localhost\n- Test various SSH config scenarios","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-05T13:06:09.063737Z","created_by":"jemanuel","updated_at":"2026-01-05T13:57:35.562900Z","closed_at":"2026-01-05T13:57:35.562900Z","close_reason":"Implementation complete: SSH host probing with parallel execution using rayon, caching layer, probe script, and comprehensive tests.","compaction_level":0,"labels":["sources","ssh"]}

{"id":"coding_agent_session_search-wdti","title":"P1.3: FTS5 Index Generation","description":"# FTS5 Index Generation\n\n**Parent Phase:** coding_agent_session_search-6uo3 (Phase 1: Core Export)\n**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 days\n\n## Goal\n\nImplement dual FTS5 full-text search indexes for client-side search: one for natural language (porter stemmer) and one for code/path search (unicode61 with special tokenchar handling).\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Dual FTS Strategy\n\nTwo indexes serve different search patterns:\n\n```sql\n-- FTS5 Index #1: Natural Language Search (porter stemmer)\n-- - \"running\" matches \"run\", \"runs\", \"runner\"\n-- - Good for: English prose, documentation, explanations\n-- NOTE: Use ONE tokenizer per FTS table (not both porter AND unicode61)\nCREATE VIRTUAL TABLE messages_fts USING fts5(\n    content,\n    content='messages',\n    content_rowid='id',\n    tokenize='porter'\n);\n\n-- FTS5 Index #2: Code/Path Search (unicode61 tokenchars)\n-- - Preserves snake_case, camelCase, file.extensions as searchable tokens\n-- - \"my_function\" is a single token (not split on underscore)\n-- - \"AuthController.ts\" matches exact filename\nCREATE VIRTUAL TABLE messages_code_fts USING fts5(\n    content,\n    content='messages',\n    content_rowid='id',\n    tokenize=\"unicode61 tokenchars '_./\\\\'\"\n);\n\n-- OPTIONAL: Trigram Index for substring matching\n-- Significantly increases index size (~3x content)\n-- CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE messages_trigram USING fts5(\n--     content, content='messages', content_rowid='id',\n--     tokenize='trigram'\n-- );\n```\n\n### Why External Content Tables\n\n- `content='messages'` means FTS stores only tokens, not full content\n- Reduces database size by ~50% compared to standalone FTS\n- Full content is fetched via JOIN when needed\n\n### Population Strategy\n\nFor static export (no triggers needed):\n```rust\npub fn populate_fts_indexes(conn: &Connection) -> Result<()> {\n    // Populate natural language FTS\n    conn.execute(\n        \"INSERT INTO messages_fts(rowid, content)\n         SELECT id, content FROM messages\",\n        [],\n    )?;\n\n    // Populate code/path FTS\n    conn.execute(\n        \"INSERT INTO messages_code_fts(rowid, content)\n         SELECT id, content FROM messages\",\n        [],\n    )?;\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n### Query Examples (for viewer.js)\n\n```javascript\n// Natural language search\nSELECT m.*, bm25(messages_fts) AS score,\n       snippet(messages_fts, 0, '<mark>', '</mark>', '…', 64) AS snippet\nFROM messages_fts\nJOIN messages m ON messages_fts.rowid = m.id\nWHERE messages_fts MATCH ?\nORDER BY score\nLIMIT 100\n\n// Code/path search\nSELECT m.*, bm25(messages_code_fts) AS score,\n       snippet(messages_code_fts, 0, '<mark>', '</mark>', '…', 64) AS snippet\nFROM messages_code_fts\nJOIN messages m ON messages_code_fts.rowid = m.id\nWHERE messages_code_fts MATCH ?\nORDER BY score\nLIMIT 100\n```\n\n### FTS5 Query Escaping (Critical Security)\n\nFTS5 has special characters that must be escaped:\n\n```rust\npub fn escape_fts5_query(query: &str) -> String {\n    // Wrap each term in double-quotes to prevent injection\n    query.split_whitespace()\n        .filter(|t| !t.is_empty())\n        .map(|t| format!(\"\\\"{}\\\"\", t.replace('\"', \"\\\"\\\"\")))\n        .collect::<Vec<_>>()\n        .join(\" \")\n}\n```\n\n## Test Cases\n\n1. Porter stemmer: \"running\" matches content with \"run\"\n2. Code tokenizer: \"my_function\" matches as single token\n3. Path search: \"AuthController.ts\" matches exact filename\n4. Empty query → empty results (no error)\n5. Special chars escaped: `\"foo\"` doesn't break query\n6. BM25 ranking: more relevant results score higher\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n- `src/pages/export.rs` (add FTS population)\n- `src/pages/fts.rs` (new - query escaping utilities)\n- `tests/pages_fts.rs` (new)\n\n## Exit Criteria\n\n1. Both FTS indexes created and populated\n2. Queries return relevant results\n3. Stemming works for natural language\n4. Code identifiers preserved as tokens\n5.

If the remote has \nnever run `cass index`, there's nothing meaningful to sync. The setup wizard \nshould ensure remotes are indexed before attempting sync.\n\nThis also provides value to users who may not realize they need to index on \neach machine.\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### Index Status Detection\nThe probe phase already detects index status via `cass health --json`. This \ntells us:\n- Whether index exists\n- Session count\n- Last index timestamp\n- Index health\n\n### Skip Logic\nSkip indexing if:\n- cass health reports healthy index with sessions\n- Index timestamp is recent (< 24 hours)\n- User explicitly passed --skip-index\n\n### RemoteIndexer Implementation\n```rust\npub struct RemoteIndexer {\n    host: String,\n    ssh_timeout: u64,\n}\n\npub struct IndexProgress {\n    pub stage: IndexStage,\n    pub message: String,\n    pub sessions_found: u64,\n    pub sessions_indexed: u64,\n}\n\npub enum IndexStage {\n    Starting,\n    Scanning { agent: String },\n    Building,\n    Complete,\n    Failed { error: String },\n}\n\npub struct IndexResult {\n    pub success: bool,\n    pub sessions_indexed: u64,\n    pub duration: Duration,\n    pub error: Option<String>,\n}\n\nimpl RemoteIndexer {\n    /// Check if indexing is needed based on probe result\n    pub fn needs_indexing(probe: &HostProbeResult) -> bool {\n        match &probe.cass_status {\n            CassStatus::NotFound => true,  // Just installed, needs index\n            CassStatus::InstalledNotIndexed { .. } => true,\n            CassStatus::Indexed { session_count, .. } => *session_count == 0,\n            CassStatus::Unknown => true,\n        }\n    }\n    \n    /// Run indexing on remote host\n    pub async fn run_index(\n        &self,\n        on_progress: impl Fn(IndexProgress),\n    ) -> Result<IndexResult, IndexError> {\n        let start = Instant::now();\n        \n        on_progress(IndexProgress {\n            stage: IndexStage::Starting,\n            message: \"Starting index...\".into(),\n            sessions_found: 0,\n            sessions_indexed: 0,\n        });\n        \n        // Run cass index with streaming output\n        let result = self.run_ssh_command_streaming(\n            \"cass index --progress\",\n            |line| {\n                if let Some(progress) = parse_index_progress(&line) {\n                    on_progress(progress);\n                }\n            }\n        ).await?;\n        \n        // Get final count\n        let health = self.run_ssh_command(\"cass health --json\").await?;\n        let session_count = parse_session_count(&health);\n        \n        Ok(IndexResult {\n            success: result.success,\n            sessions_indexed: session_count,\n            duration: start.elapsed(),\n            error: result.error,\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Long-Running Index Handling\nFor hosts with many sessions (100k+), indexing can take 10+ minutes:\n\n```rust\n/// For long indexes, use background execution with polling\nasync fn run_long_index(&self, on_progress: impl Fn(IndexProgress)) -> Result<IndexResult> {\n    // Start index in background\n    self.run_ssh_command(\"nohup cass index > ~/.cass_index.log 2>&1 &\").await?;\n    \n    // Poll progress\n    loop {\n        let log = self.run_ssh_command(\"tail -20 ~/.cass_index.log\").await?;\n        \n        if let Some(progress) = parse_index_progress(&log) {\n            on_progress(progress);\n            \n            if progress.stage == IndexStage::Complete {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        \n        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2)).await;\n    }\n    \n    // Get final result\n    self.get_index_result().await\n}\n```\n\n### Progress Display\n```\nIndexing sessions on yto...\n  Scanning ~/.claude/projects... found 234 sessions\n  Scanning ~/.codex/sessions... found 12 sessions\n  Scanning ~/.gemini/tmp... found 45 sessions\n  \n  Building search index...\n  ████████████████████████████████████░░░░░░ 75% (219/291)\n  \n✓ Indexed 291 sessions on yto (45s)\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n```rust\npub enum IndexError {\n    SshFailed(String),\n    CassNotFound,\n    IndexFailed { \n        stdout: String, \n        stderr: String,\n        exit_code: i32,\n    },\n    DiskFull,\n    Timeout,\n}\n\nfn handle_index_error(error: &IndexError) -> String {\n    match error {\n        IndexError::DiskFull => {\n            \"Disk full on remote.

This task sets up:\n1. Automated benchmark comparison in CI\n2. Performance thresholds that fail the build\n3. Baseline tracking across commits\n\n## Current State\n\n### Existing Guardrails\n- `tests/robot_perf.rs`: Latency thresholds for robot commands\n- `tests/cli_robot.rs:334`: Sessions output metamorphic parity\n- `src/search/tantivy.rs:785`: title_prefix matching test\n\nThese are correctness tests, not performance regression tests.\n\n### Missing\n- Automated benchmark comparison in CI\n- Baseline storage and tracking\n- Threshold-based failure for regressions\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow for Benchmarks\n\n```yaml\n# .github/workflows/perf.yml\nname: Performance Benchmarks\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [main]\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n\njobs:\n  bench:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      \n      - name: Install Rust (nightly)\n        uses: dtolnay/rust-action@nightly\n        \n      - name: Restore baseline\n        uses: actions/cache@v4\n        with:\n          path: target/criterion\n          key: bench-baseline-${{ github.base_ref }}\n          \n      - name: Run benchmarks\n        run: cargo bench --bench runtime_perf -- --save-baseline pr\n        \n      - name: Compare to baseline\n        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'\n        run: |\n          cargo install critcmp\n          critcmp main pr --threshold 10\n          # Fails if any benchmark regresses by >10%\n          \n      - name: Save baseline (on merge to main)\n        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'\n        run: |\n          cargo bench --bench runtime_perf -- --save-baseline main\n```\n\n### 2. Critical Benchmark Thresholds\n\n| Benchmark | Threshold | Rationale |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| `search_latency` | < 50 µs | TUI responsiveness |\n| `vector_index_search_50k` | < 10 ms (after opts) | Semantic search target |\n| `index_small_batch` | < 20 ms | Indexing throughput |\n| `canonicalize_long_message` | < 500 µs (after opt) | Index-time target |\n\n### 3. Memory Regression Tests\n\n```rust\n// tests/perf_memory.rs\nuse std::alloc::{GlobalAlloc, Layout, System};\nuse std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};\n\nstruct TrackingAllocator;\n\nstatic ALLOCATED: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);\nstatic PEAK: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);\n\n#[global_allocator]\nstatic ALLOC: TrackingAllocator = TrackingAllocator;\n\nunsafe impl GlobalAlloc for TrackingAllocator {\n    unsafe fn alloc(&self, layout: Layout) -> *mut u8 {\n        let ptr = System.alloc(layout);\n        if !ptr.is_null() {\n            let current = ALLOCATED.fetch_add(layout.size(), Ordering::SeqCst) + layout.size();\n            PEAK.fetch_max(current, Ordering::SeqCst);\n        }\n        ptr\n    }\n\n    unsafe fn dealloc(&self, ptr: *mut u8, layout: Layout) {\n        ALLOCATED.fetch_sub(layout.size(), Ordering::SeqCst);\n        System.dealloc(ptr, layout)\n    }\n}\n\n#[test]\nfn indexing_peak_memory_regression() {\n    // Index test corpus\n    let _stats = index_test_corpus();\n    \n    let peak_mb = PEAK.load(Ordering::SeqCst) / 1_000_000;\n    assert!(peak_mb < 350, \"Peak memory {}MB exceeds 350MB threshold\", peak_mb);\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Benchmark Result Artifact Collection\n\n```yaml\n- name: Upload benchmark results\n  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4\n  with:\n    name: benchmark-results\n    path: target/criterion/**/*.json\n    retention-days: 30\n```\n\nThis enables historical analysis and trend detection.\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\n1. [ ] Create `.github/workflows/perf.yml`\n2. [ ] Add `critcmp` comparison step\n3. [ ] Set appropriate thresholds for each benchmark\n4. [ ] Add memory tracking test\n5. [ ] Configure artifact retention\n6. [ ] Add PR comment bot for benchmark diffs (optional)\n7. [ ] Document threshold rationale in README\n\n## Validation Commands\n\nAfter implementing, verify with:\n```bash\n# Run benchmarks locally\ncargo bench --bench runtime_perf -- --save-baseline before\n\n# Make a change\n# ...\n\n# Compare\ncargo bench --bench runtime_perf -- --save-baseline after\ncargo install critcmp && critcmp before after\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Should be set up BEFORE implementing P0 optimizations\n- Provides baseline for measuring optimization impact\n- Prevents future regressions from erasing gains","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"","created_at":"2026-01-10T03:03:35.616736592Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T02:10:13.426637309Z","closed_at":"2026-01-11T02:10:13.426637309Z","close_reason":"Completed","compaction_level":0}

Encryption is mandatory for safety, not optional.\n\n## Key Innovation: Envelope Encryption\n\n- export_id (16B random): Unique per export, used as AAD binding\n- DEK (Data Encryption Key): Random 256-bit, encrypts payload chunks\n- KEK (Key Encryption Key): Derived from password via Argon2id\n- Benefits: Password rotation without re-encrypt, multiple key slots, AAD prevents replay\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n1. **CLI (Rust)**: PagesWizard, ExportEngine, EncryptionModule, BundleBuilder, Deployer\n2. **Browser Runtime**: AuthModule, CryptoModule, DatabaseModule, SearchUI, ConversationUI\n\n## Functional Requirements Summary\n\n- **FR-1**: Content Selection (agents, time range, workspaces, path privacy)\n- **FR-2**: Envelope Encryption (AES-256-GCM, Argon2id, key slots)\n- **FR-3**: Static Site Generation (sqlite-wasm, dual FTS5, CSP-safe UI)\n- **FR-4**: Deployment (GitHub Pages, Cloudflare, local export, chunked AEAD)\n- **FR-5**: Safety Guardrails (explicit consent, pre-publish summary)\n- **FR-6**: Redaction & Share Profiles (secrets, usernames, paths)\n- **FR-7**: Attachment Support (opt-in, blobs/ directory)\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n- **NFR-1**: Zero plaintext in public repo, no metadata leakage\n- **NFR-2**: <3s initial load on 3G, <100ms search latency\n- **NFR-3**: bv-level wizard polish, clear error messages\n- **NFR-4**: Chrome 102+, Firefox 111+, Safari 15.2+, Edge 102+\n\n## Implementation Phases (6 total, ~9-14 weeks)\n\n- **Phase 1**: Core Export\n- **Phase 2**: Encryption\n- **Phase 3**: Web Viewer\n- **Phase 4**: Wizard & Deployment\n- **Phase 5**: Polish & Safety\n- **Phase 6**: Testing & Hardening\n\n## File Structure (Split Output)\n\nsite/ → DEPLOY THIS (safe for public hosting)\nprivate/ → NEVER DEPLOY (recovery secrets, QR code)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. User can export encrypted archive via wizard or CLI\n2. Viewer works offline after initial load\n3. Password unlock takes 2-3 seconds (Argon2id)\n4. Search latency <100ms with 100K+ messages\n5.
