**Subject:** Claiming bead h2b - Claude Code Connector Tests

I'm picking up **h2b** to add unit tests for the Claude Code connector (`src/connectors/claude_code.rs`).

This is high-impact since Claude Code is the primary agent this tool serves. Tests will cover:
- Session file discovery  
- JSONL conversation parsing
- Message extraction and role handling
- Timestamp parsing
- Workspace inference
- Edge cases (malformed, empty, interrupted sessions)
